## P0 — Core Shell

<!-- Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest epic-health_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`. Use **plain CSS** (no Tailwind) for pixel-accurate styling matching MyChart screenshots.

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/dashboard_000001.jpg` and `assets/screenshots/messaging_000001.jpg` carefully. Create `src/styles/variables.css` with CSS custom properties:
  - `--color-header-bg`: Linear gradient from `#0075BC` to `#004B87` (deep blue/teal)
  - `--color-header-text`: `#FFFFFF`
  - `--color-nav-bg`: `#F5F5F5` (light gray tab bar)
  - `--color-nav-active`: `#FFFFFF` with `#0075BC` bottom border (2px)
  - `--color-nav-text`: `#333333`, active: `#0075BC`
  - `--color-body-bg`: `#FFFFFF`, section bg: `#F0F2F5`
  - `--color-primary`: `#0075BC` (teal/blue links, buttons)
  - `--color-success`: `#00875A` (green — check-in, confirm buttons)
  - `--color-danger`: `#D32F2F` (red — cancel, urgent)
  - `--color-warning`: `#FF9800` (orange — attention)
  - `--color-text-primary`: `#333333`
  - `--color-text-secondary`: `#757575`
  - `--color-border`: `#E0E0E0`
  - `--color-badge`: `#E53935` (red unread badge)
  - `--color-card-bg`: `#FFFFFF`
  - `--color-sidebar-bg`: `#FFFFFF`
  - `--font-family`: `"Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`
  - Font sizes: `--font-xs: 12px`, `--font-sm: 13px`, `--font-base: 14px`, `--font-md: 16px`, `--font-lg: 18px`, `--font-xl: 22px`, `--font-xxl: 24px`
  - `--radius-sm: 4px`, `--radius-md: 8px`, `--radius-lg: 12px`
  - `--shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`, `--shadow-md: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`

- [x] **App layout** (`src/App.jsx` + `src/App.css`): As seen in `dashboard_000001.jpg`:
  - **Top header bar**: Full-width, 50px height, blue gradient background. Left: "MyChart" logo text (white, with small "MyChart by Epic" sub-logo). Right: globe icon (language), user avatar circle (40px, teal with white initials "SC") + "Sarah Chen" text + "Switch ▼" dropdown, logout icon.
  - **Navigation tab bar**: Full-width, 44px, light gray `#F5F5F5` background, below header. Tab items with icons: 🏠 `Your Menu` (hamburger icon) | 📅 `Visits` | ✉ `Messages` (with red badge for unread count) | 🔬 `Test Results` | 💰 `Billing & Insurance`. Each tab is ~120px wide, separated by subtle dividers. Active tab has white background and blue bottom border.
  - **Main content area**: Max-width 1200px, centered, padding 20px on sides. Background `#F0F2F5`.
  - **Slide-out sidebar** ("Your Menu"): 340px wide panel that slides in from left when "Your Menu" tab is clicked. White background with shadow. Search input at top ("Search the menu"), then categorized menu items with small icons (see full list in `messaging_000001.jpg` screenshot). Categories: **Find Care** (Schedule an Appointment, E-Visit, View Care Team), **Communication** (Messages, Ask a Question, Letters), **My Record** (Visits, Test Results, Medications, Health Summary, Preventive Care, Questionnaires, Medical and Family History), **Billing** (Billing Summary, Insurance). Click item → navigate to route, close sidebar.

- [x] **Routing** (`src/App.jsx` with BrowserRouter): Define routes:
  - `/` → Dashboard/Home
  - `/visits` → Visits (upcoming + past)
  - `/visits/:id` → Visit Detail
  - `/schedule` → Schedule Appointment flow
  - `/messages` → Messages inbox
  - `/messages/compose` → Compose new message
  - `/messages/:threadId` → Message thread view
  - `/test-results` → Test Results list
  - `/test-results/:id` → Test Result detail
  - `/medications` → Medications list
  - `/medications/:id` → Medication detail
  - `/medications/refill` → Request refill flow
  - `/health-summary` → Health Summary (conditions, allergies, vitals, immunizations)
  - `/billing` → Billing summary
  - `/billing/:id` → Statement detail
  - `/billing/pay` → Pay bill form
  - `/insurance` → Insurance info
  - `/preventive-care` → Preventive care checklist
  - `/care-team` → Care team provider list
  - `/settings` → Account settings
  - `/go` → State inspection JSON endpoint (GoPage component)

- [x] **State management**: `src/context/AppContext.jsx` wrapping entire app. Provides `state` and `dispatch` (useReducer pattern). Actions: `SET_STATE`, `UPDATE_APPOINTMENT`, `ADD_MESSAGE`, `MARK_MESSAGE_READ`, `UPDATE_MEDICATION`, `REQUEST_REFILL`, `DISMISS_NOTIFICATION`, `SET_ACTIVE_SECTION`, `TOGGLE_SIDEBAR`, `CANCEL_APPOINTMENT`, `PAY_BILL`, `SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT`. On mount, check for server-injected state via `fetch('/state?sid=...')` then fall back to `createInitialData()` from `src/utils/dataManager.js`. Persist current state to localStorage on every change. Expose `window.__APP_STATE__` for state inspection.

- [x] **Data manager** (`src/utils/dataManager.js`): Implement `createInitialData()` returning full data structure per `assets/data_model.md`. All 13 entity types with realistic seed data. Include the exact records specified in data_model.md tables. Export `INITIAL_STATE` for use in vite.config.js.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` at route `/go` that renders JSON with `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`. Also implement the server-side `/go` handler in `vite.config.js` (copy the standard pattern from `gmail_mock/vite.config.js` — includes `/go`, `/state`, `/post` with `set`/`set_current`/`reset` actions, `/upload`, `/files` endpoints). Import `INITIAL_STATE` from data manager.

- [x] **Session isolation**: In `vite.config.js`, implement the full mock-api plugin with session support (`?sid=` parameter) for `/post`, `/state`, `/go`, `/upload`, `/files` endpoints. Copy the exact pattern from the gmail_mock vite.config.js (which is the repo standard). Duplicate for both `configureServer` and `configurePreviewServer`.

## Out of Scope

<!-- Dev must NOT implement these. -->

- Authentication / login / logout (app starts pre-logged-in as Sarah Chen)
- Password management, account creation, two-step verification
- Real FHIR API integration or network calls
- Actual video visits / telehealth streaming
- Real file uploads to servers
- Email/SMS/push notifications
- PDF document generation
- Encryption or security mechanisms
- Real payment processing
- Database persistence (use localStorage only)
