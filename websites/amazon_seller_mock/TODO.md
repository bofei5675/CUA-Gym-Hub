## P0 -- Core Shell

Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first.

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest amazon_seller_mock -- --template react` in the project directory, install deps: `react-router-dom`, `recharts` (for charts), `lucide-react` (icons). No TypeScript -- use plain JSX. No Tailwind -- use plain CSS matching DESIGN.md specifications exactly.

- [x] **Global CSS reset and base styles**: Create `src/index.css` with the full color palette from DESIGN.md as CSS custom properties (`--amazon-navy: #232f3e`, `--amazon-orange: #ff9900`, `--page-bg: #f5f7fa`, `--link-blue: #0066c0`, etc.). Set font-family to `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`. Set `body { margin: 0; background: var(--page-bg); font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; color: #111; }`.

- [x] **App layout (AppLayout component)**: Fixed top navigation bar (50px height, full width, `#232f3e` background) + main content area below. No persistent sidebar -- sidebar only appears as overlay when hamburger menu is clicked. Content area: `max-width: 1400px`, centered, `padding: 20px horizontal, 16px top`. See DESIGN.md Section 4 for exact spacing.

- [x] **Top Navigation Bar**: Height 50px, bg `#232f3e`, position fixed, z-index 1000. Left section: hamburger icon (3 white bars, 20px, clickable to open sidebar) + 12px gap + "amazon" text in white with orange smile arrow underneath + "Seller Central" in white 14px text. Center: search input bar (white bg, border-radius 4px, max-width 400px, placeholder "Search Seller Central", magnifying glass icon left). Right: notification bell icon (with red badge showing `seller.notificationCount`), US flag icon (marketplace), mail/envelope icon (with badge showing `seller.unreadMessages`), gear icon, "Help" text link, display name `seller.displayName` -- all white, 16px gap between items. Clicking notification bell opens a dropdown panel listing `notifications[]` (each shows icon by type, title, relative timestamp, unread dot). Clicking mail icon navigates to `/messages`.

- [x] **Sidebar Navigation (Hamburger Overlay)**: When hamburger is clicked, a dark overlay (`rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`) covers the page, and a 280px-wide panel slides in from the left with bg `#232f3e`. Close X button at top-right of panel. Menu sections separated by `#3b4a5c` dividers. Each section header: 12px uppercase text, `#999` color. Each item: 14px white text, 44px row height, 16px left padding, hover bg `#37475a`. Sections and sub-items (each sub-item is a `<Link>` that navigates and closes sidebar):
  - **Catalog**: Add Products (`/catalog/add-product`)
  - **Inventory**: Manage All Inventory (`/inventory`), Manage FBA Inventory (`/inventory/fba`), Inventory Planning (`/inventory/planning`), Manage FBA Shipments (`/inventory/shipments`)
  - **Pricing**: Manage Pricing (`/pricing`), Automate Pricing (`/pricing/automate`)
  - **Orders**: Manage Orders (`/orders`), Order Reports (`/orders/reports`), Manage Returns (`/returns`)
  - **Advertising**: Campaign Manager (`/advertising`), Create Campaign (`/advertising/create`)
  - **Stores**: Manage Stores (`/stores`) -- placeholder page
  - **Growth**: Growth Opportunities (`/growth`) -- placeholder page
  - **Reports**: Business Reports (`/reports`), Payments (`/payments`), Advertising Reports (`/reports/advertising`)
  - **Performance**: Account Health (`/account-health`), Feedback (`/feedback`), Voice of the Customer (`/performance/voc`) -- placeholder page
  - **B2B**: B2B Central (`/b2b`) -- placeholder page
  - **Brands**: Brand Dashboard (`/brands`) -- placeholder page
  - **Settings**: Account Info (`/settings`), Notification Preferences (`/settings/notifications`), Shipping Settings (`/settings/shipping`)

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`. All routes implemented.

- [x] **State management**: `AppContext.jsx` with React Context + useReducer. Load initial data from `dataManager.js` via `initializeData()`. Expose `state` and `dispatch` globally. Actions: `SET_STATE`, `UPDATE_PRODUCT`, `ADD_PRODUCT`, `DELETE_PRODUCT`, `UPDATE_ORDER`, `ADD_ORDER`, `SEND_MESSAGE`, `UPDATE_RETURN`, `UPDATE_CAMPAIGN`, `ADD_CAMPAIGN`, `UPDATE_SETTINGS`, `MARK_NOTIFICATION_READ`, `ADD_FEEDBACK_RESPONSE`, `UPDATE_COUPON`.

- [x] **dataManager.js**: Follow the exact pattern from existing mocks (slack_mock). Include: `getSessionId()`, `getInitialState(sid)`, `fetchCustomState(sid)`, `saveState(state, sid)`, `initializeData(sid, customState)`, `createInitialData()`. All entities defined in `assets/data_model.md` with realistic values.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` + route. Reads `initialState` from `localStorage` and `currentState` from context. Computes `state_diff` as a deep-diff. Renders raw JSON.

- [x] **Session isolation**: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin. Handles POST /post, GET /state, GET /go with ?sid=xxx session isolation.
