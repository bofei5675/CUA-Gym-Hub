## P0 — Core Shell
<!-- Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest bamboohr_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/` carefully. BambooHR uses a **clean, corporate green** palette:
  - Primary brand green: `#73B255` (buttons, links, active states, icons)
  - Dark green (profile banner, header accents): `#2E7D32`
  - Top nav background: `#FFFFFF` with light bottom border `#E0E0E0`
  - Page background: `#F5F5F5`
  - Card/content background: `#FFFFFF`
  - Text primary: `#333333`, secondary: `#666666`, muted: `#999999`
  - Border/divider: `#E0E0E0`
  - Alert/overdue badge: `#E65100` (orange-red)
  - Font: `"Inter", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`
  - Nav text: 14px medium weight; Page headers: 20px bold; Section headers: 18px bold with green icon; Body: 14px regular; Employee name on banner: 28px bold white

- [x] **App layout — Top navigation bar**: Full-width white bar, ~56px height, fixed at top. Left: BambooHR-style green logo text `"bambooHR"` in brand green italic script font. Center: horizontal nav links — Home, My Info, People, Hiring, Reports, Files — each ~14px medium weight, active link has green underline (3px solid `#73B255`). Right cluster: search icon (magnifying glass) opening a search input, notification bell icon with red badge count (e.g., "12"), help icon (question mark in circle), settings gear icon, and user avatar (32px circle) with dropdown menu. Nav items should have hover state (green text color shift).

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`. Define routes:
  - `/` → Home (dashboard)
  - `/my-info` → My Info (current user's own employee profile)
  - `/my-info/:tab` → My Info with specific tab selected
  - `/people` → Employee directory (grid view)
  - `/people/org-chart` → Org chart view
  - `/people/:id` → Employee profile
  - `/people/:id/:tab` → Employee profile with specific tab
  - `/hiring` → Job openings list
  - `/hiring/:id` → Job opening detail with candidate pipeline
  - `/reports` → Reports list
  - `/reports/:id` → Report detail/results view
  - `/files` → Company files
  - `/settings` → Settings page
  - `/go` → State inspection endpoint

- [x] **State management**: `AppContext.jsx` providing global state + `utils/dataManager.js` with `createInitialData()` (see `data_model.md` for full structure). State stored in localStorage under key `bamboohr_state`. Context provides: `state`, `dispatch`, and helper functions: `getEmployee(id)`, `getDepartment(id)`, `getLocation(id)`, `updateEmployee(id, changes)`, `addTimeOffRequest(request)`, `updateTimeOffRequest(id, changes)`, `addCandidate(candidate)`, `updateCandidate(id, changes)`, `addNote(note)`, `addAnnouncement(announcement)`.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` + route. Returns JSON with `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`. Computes deep diff of all state arrays/objects. Show raw JSON in a `<pre>` tag with monospace formatting.

- [x] **Session isolation**: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin. `POST /post?sid=<sid>` accepts `{"action":"set","state":{...}}` to set both initial + current state; `{"action":"set_current","state":{...}}` for current only; `{"action":"reset"}` to restore initial. `GET /go?sid=<sid>` returns `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`. Session data stored in-memory Map keyed by sid. `GET /state?sid=<sid>` alias for `/go`.

- [x] **Seed data**: Populate `createInitialData()` with ~30 employees across 10 departments, 3 locations, realistic org hierarchy (CEO → VPs → Managers → ICs). Current user = Charlotte Abbott (id: 1), HR Admin. Include time-off balances (Vacation: 54.6 hrs, Sick: 24.0 hrs), 8 time-off requests (2 pending, 4 approved, 1 denied, 1 completed), 4 job openings with 12 candidates, 4 announcements, 12 notifications, training records, assets, goals, benefit enrollments. See `data_model.md` for full entity specs and suggested values.
