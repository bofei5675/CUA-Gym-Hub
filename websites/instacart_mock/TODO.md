## P0 — Core Shell

<!-- Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest instacart_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`, no CSS framework (use plain CSS for pixel-accurate control). Project directory already exists at `instacart_mock/`.

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/` — the Instacart brand uses a clean, modern grocery aesthetic. Implement these exact values as CSS custom properties in `src/index.css`:
  - Primary green: `#0AAD0A` (CTA buttons, links, active states, "Add" buttons)
  - Dark green: `#003D29` (header background for logged-in state, footer)
  - White: `#FFFFFF` (card backgrounds, modals, main content bg)
  - Page background: `#F6F7F8` (light gray behind content)
  - Primary text: `#343538` (dark, near-black)
  - Secondary text: `#72767E` (muted gray for prices-per-unit, timestamps, descriptions)
  - Border: `#E8E9EB` (card borders, dividers, input borders)
  - Orange accent: `#FF7009` (Instacart carrot logo element, sale badges)
  - Red/Sale: `#DF1B41` (sale prices, error states, out-of-stock)
  - Font: `"Inter", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`
  - Border radius for cards: `12px`, for buttons/pills: `24px`, for inputs: `8px`
  - Base spacing unit: `4px` (all spacing in multiples: 8, 12, 16, 24, 32)
  - Max content width: `1280px`, centered with `margin: 0 auto`

- [x] **App layout**: Full-width header (fixed, 64px height, dark green `#003D29` background). Below header: main content area, full width, light gray background. No persistent sidebar — navigation is via header and in-page links. Cart is a right-side flyout panel (400px wide) triggered by cart icon click.

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`. Define these routes:
  - `/` → Homepage (store grid, promotions, buy-it-again, deals)
  - `/store/:storeSlug` → Store storefront (departments, featured products)
  - `/store/:storeSlug/department/:deptSlug` → Department product listing
  - `/store/:storeSlug/search?q=` → Search results within store
  - `/product/:productId` → Product detail page (alternatively use modal overlay)
  - `/checkout` → Checkout page
  - `/orders` → Order history list
  - `/orders/:orderId` → Order detail
  - `/lists` → Shopping lists
  - `/lists/:listId` → Individual list detail
  - `/recipes` → Recipe browser
  - `/recipes/:recipeId` → Recipe detail
  - `/deals` → Deals & coupons page
  - `/buy-it-again` → Buy It Again page
  - `/account` → Account settings
  - `/account/addresses` → Address management
  - `/go` → State inspection endpoint (JSON)

- [x] **State management**: Create `src/context/AppContext.jsx` as the global provider wrapping the app. Create `src/utils/dataManager.js` with `createInitialData()` function that returns all seed data (see `data_model.md` for complete structure). Use `useReducer` inside AppContext for all state mutations. Persist to `localStorage` under key `instacart_mock_state`. Load from localStorage on init, fallback to `createInitialData()`.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: Create `src/pages/Go.jsx` mapped to route `/go`. On mount, compute and return JSON: `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. `initial_state` is the value from `createInitialData()`. `current_state` is the live state from AppContext. `state_diff` is a deep diff showing only changed fields. Render the JSON in a `<pre>` block with `JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)`.

- [x] **Session isolation**: In `vite.config.js`, add a plugin providing mock API middleware:
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` — accepts `{ action: "set" | "set_current" | "reset", state: {...} }`. `"set"` replaces both initial and current state. `"set_current"` updates only current state. `"reset"` restores current state to initial state.
  - `GET /go?sid=<sid>` — returns `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }` as JSON
  - `GET /state?sid=<sid>` — alias for `/go?sid=<sid>`
  - Session state stored in a `Map<sid, { initial, current }>` in the server plugin.
  - When the app loads with `?sid=X` query param, it fetches state from the server instead of localStorage.

## Data Seed (implement in createInitialData())

<!-- Dev must create realistic seed data matching these specs. See data_model.md for field definitions. -->

- [x] **User**: 1 pre-logged-in user — "Sarah Johnson", email: sarah.johnson@email.com, Instacart+ member, default address in San Francisco, CA
- [x] **Addresses**: 2 — "Home" (742 Evergreen Terrace, SF) and "Work" (200 Market Street, SF)
- [x] **Stores**: 8 stores with realistic names, logos (use emoji + colored initial), delivery fees, delivery times. See data_model.md §Store for full list: Safeway, Costco, Whole Foods Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, CVS Pharmacy, Target, Petco, Total Wine & More
- [x] **Departments**: 14 standard departments per grocery store (Produce, Dairy & Eggs, Meat & Seafood, Bakery, Deli, Frozen, Pantry, Snacks & Candy, Beverages, Breakfast, Household, Health & Beauty, Baby & Kids, Pet Care) each with 3-4 subcategories. See data_model.md §Department for full list.

At minimum: 12 Produce, 10 Dairy, 8 Meat, 6 Bakery, 8 Frozen, 10 Pantry, 8 Snacks, 8 Beverages, 6 Household, 4 Health. ~15% on sale, ~30% organic. Use realistic US grocery prices. Each product needs: name, brand, description (1 sentence), price, unit size, unit price, nutrition facts (at least calories + macros), and 2-3 tags. For product images, use a colored placeholder square with a relevant emoji centered (e.g., 🍌 for bananas, 🥛 for milk). See data_model.md §Product for field definitions and example product list.
- [x] **Cart**: Pre-load 4-6 items from Safeway (store_1) in the cart to show a realistic starting state. Include: Organic Bananas (qty 3), 2% Milk (qty 1), Chicken Breast (qty 2), Sourdough Bread (qty 1), Greek Yogurt (qty 2).
- [x] **Orders**: 5 past orders, all "delivered" status, spanning the past month. Each with 6-14 items, realistic totals ($43-$125). See data_model.md §Order for structure.
- [x] **Shopping Lists**: 3 lists — "Weekly Essentials" (8 items, mix checked/unchecked), "Party Supplies" (12 items, all unchecked), "Healthy Eating" (6 items, some checked). See data_model.md §ShoppingList.
- [x] **Recipes**: 6 recipes with linked product IDs. See data_model.md §Recipe for list.
- [x] **Deals**: 8 deals across stores. See data_model.md §Deal for full list.
- [x] **Delivery Slots**: Generate for 5 days (today through +4), each day with 5-8 time windows, some unavailable. See data_model.md §DeliverySlot.

## Out of Scope

<!-- Dev must NOT implement these. -->

- Authentication / login / signup (app starts pre-logged-in as `Sarah Johnson`)
- Real payment processing or Stripe/PayPal integration
- Real geolocation or map APIs (use hardcoded SF address)
- Real-time shopper communication / chat
- Push notifications or email/SMS sending
- Real store inventory management or availability checking
- File uploads (receipt scanning, etc.)
- Real product image assets (use emoji + colored placeholder squares)
- Server-side rendering or SEO optimization
- Accessibility (ARIA) beyond basic semantic HTML (not a priority for agent training)
- Dark mode (Instacart doesn't have one on web)
- Mobile app simulation (web only)
