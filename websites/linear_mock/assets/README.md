# Linear Mock -- Research Summary

## App Overview

Linear is a project management and issue tracking tool purpose-built for software development teams. It emphasizes speed, keyboard-first navigation, and an opinionated workflow. Linear is the primary competitor to Jira in the modern developer tools space, differentiated by its extreme performance, minimal UI, and dark-mode-first aesthetic.

The desktop web app (linear.app) is the primary interface. It uses a three-panel layout: left sidebar for navigation, main content area for issue lists/boards, and an optional right detail panel.

## Key User Personas

1. **Engineering Lead** (primary): Creates issues, manages sprints/cycles, reviews project progress, triages incoming bugs. Daily workflow: check inbox, review cycle progress, update issue statuses, create new issues, review project health.

2. **Individual Developer**: Works through assigned issues, updates status, adds comments, checks inbox for mentions. Daily workflow: view "My Issues", pick up next task, update status, comment on blockers.

3. **Product Manager**: Creates projects, writes specs, tracks project health, sends project updates. Workflow: create projects, add issues to projects, monitor progress, write updates.

4. **Designer**: Works on design-specific issues, cross-team collaboration. Similar to developer workflow but within design team.

## Core Workflows for Agent Training

1. **Issue CRUD**: Create, view, edit, delete issues with all properties (status, priority, assignee, labels, estimate, project, cycle, due date)
2. **Navigation**: Move between inbox, my issues, team views, project views, cycle views using sidebar and keyboard shortcuts
3. **Triage**: Review new issues in triage, accept or reject, assign priority and team member
4. **Cycle management**: View current cycle, add/remove issues, complete cycle, view past cycles
5. **Project tracking**: View project progress, filter issues by project, update project status
6. **Search and filter**: Use command palette (Cmd+K) and filter bar to find issues
7. **Board and list views**: Toggle between board (kanban) and list layouts, group/sort/filter
8. **Inbox management**: Read notifications, archive, snooze, mark as read
9. **Bulk operations**: Select multiple issues, bulk update status/assignee/priority/labels
10. **Keyboard-driven workflow**: Navigate and perform actions entirely via keyboard
