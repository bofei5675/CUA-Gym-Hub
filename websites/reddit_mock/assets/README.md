## What to Skip (Out of Scope)

- **Real API calls** — All data from localStorage/dataManager
- **File uploads** — Image posts use URL input, not file upload
- **Reddit Premium/Gold** — Visual only, no purchase flow
- **Moderation tools** — No mod queue, automod, ban management (keep visual moderator badges only)
- **Real-time updates** — No WebSocket, polling, or live comment updates
- **Video/GIF posts** — Only text, image (URL), and link post types
- **Reddit Chat** — Full chat system out of scope (show icon in navbar but non-functional)
- **Advertising** — No ad cards in feed
- **Custom CSS themes** — Subreddits use predefined banner colors only
