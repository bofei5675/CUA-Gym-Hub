## App Overview

**Notion** is an all-in-one productivity workspace combining note-taking, project management, databases, and collaboration. Its core innovation is the **block-based architecture** — everything (text, images, lists, pages, database rows) is a "block" that can be nested, rearranged, and transformed. Users build custom workflows by combining pages, databases, and blocks.

## Key User Personas & Primary Workflows

### 1. Knowledge Worker (Primary)
- **Daily workflow**: Open workspace → navigate sidebar → open/edit pages → create notes → organize with headings/lists/toggles → search for content
- **Key interactions**: Block editing, slash commands, page hierarchy, favorites, search

### 2. Project Manager
- **Daily workflow**: Open database → switch between table/board/calendar views → filter by status/assignee → drag cards between columns → update properties → add new items
- **Key interactions**: Database CRUD, view switching, filtering, sorting, board drag-and-drop

### 3. Team Collaborator
- **Daily workflow**: Check inbox/updates → navigate shared pages → leave comments → mention teammates → share pages
- **Key interactions**: Comments, @mentions, sharing, notifications
