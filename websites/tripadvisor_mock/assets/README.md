# Tripadvisor Mock -- Research & Assets

## App Overview

Tripadvisor is the world's largest travel guidance platform, operating in 40+ countries and 20+ languages. It aggregates over 1 billion reviews and opinions on approximately 8 million establishments including hotels, restaurants, attractions, and experiences. The platform serves as both a review/discovery site and a metasearch engine that compares prices across booking partners.

**Core purpose**: Help travelers discover, research, and plan trips by leveraging crowd-sourced reviews, ratings, photos, and price comparisons.

## Key User Personas

1. **Trip Planner (Primary)**: Searches for hotels, restaurants, and things to do in a destination. Reads reviews, compares prices, saves favorites to a trip, and eventually books through partner links.
2. **Review Contributor**: Writes reviews for places they have visited, uploads photos, answers questions, and earns contributor badges.
3. **Local Explorer**: Uses Tripadvisor to discover restaurants and attractions nearby, filtering by cuisine, price, and rating.
4. **Deal Hunter**: Searches for hotel deals, compares prices across booking sites, and looks for Travelers' Choice award winners.

## Primary Workflows

1. **Search for a destination** -- type a city/region/hotel name into the search bar
2. **Browse hotel listings** -- filter by price, rating, amenities; sort by Best Value/Traveler Ranked/Price
3. **View hotel detail** -- photos, map, reviews, prices from multiple booking partners, amenities, Q&A
4. **Browse restaurant listings** -- filter by cuisine, price range, dietary; sort by rating
5. **View restaurant detail** -- menu, reviews, photos, map, hours, make reservation link
6. **Browse things to do** -- filter by category, price, duration; sort by popularity
7. **Read and write reviews** -- view all reviews with filters, write a new review with rating
8. **Save to trip** -- heart/save listings to named trips for later reference
9. **Manage trips** -- create trips, add/remove saves, share with travel companions

## Notes on Scope

### Out of scope (do NOT implement):
- Authentication / login / signup (app starts pre-logged-in as a default user)
- Real booking / payment processing
- Real price comparison API calls
- Real map integration (use static placeholder)
- Email verification
- File uploads to real servers
- Real-time chat or messaging

### Simplifications:
- Price comparison shows mock partner prices (not real)
- Map view shows a static placeholder image or simple CSS representation
- Photo gallery uses placeholder travel images
- Forum posts are pre-seeded, no real-time updates
- Search autocomplete uses client-side filtering of seeded data
