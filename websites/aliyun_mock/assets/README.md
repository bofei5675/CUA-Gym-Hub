# Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Console Mock -- Assets

## Overview

This directory contains research materials, reference screenshots, and data model documentation for building a faithful mock of the Alibaba Cloud management console (console.aliyun.com).

## App Summary

**Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun)** is China's largest cloud computing platform and a subsidiary of Alibaba Group. The management console is the web-based GUI where users create, manage, and monitor cloud infrastructure resources. It serves a similar role to AWS Console, Azure Portal, or Google Cloud Console, but with a distinct design language based on the Alibaba Fusion design system.

### Key User Personas

1. **DevOps Engineer** -- Manages ECS instances, configures security groups, monitors resource health. Primary workflow: launch/stop/restart instances, check monitoring, adjust configurations.
2. **Backend Developer** -- Uses RDS databases, OSS storage, manages application deployments. Primary workflow: connect to databases, upload files to OSS, check logs.
3. **System Administrator** -- Oversees billing, resource access management, VPC networking. Primary workflow: review bills, manage IAM policies, configure VPCs.
4. **Team Lead / Manager** -- Reviews spending, resource utilization, sets budgets. Primary workflow: billing dashboard, cost analysis, resource overview.

### Core Workflows (for agent training)

1. Navigate between services using top search bar or sidebar
2. View and filter resource lists (ECS instances, OSS buckets, etc.)
3. Perform CRUD operations on cloud resources
4. Change region to see different resource sets
5. Review billing and cost information
6. Configure security group rules
7. Monitor resource health via alarms
8. Manage instance lifecycle (start, stop, restart, release)

## Technology Notes

- Built on Alibaba Fusion design system (React component library)
- Chinese-first UI with English translations available
- Uses Chinese font stack: PingFang SC, Microsoft YaHei, then western fallbacks
- The Aliyun brand color is orange (#FF6A00) but the console primarily uses blue (#0070CC) for interactive elements
- Design is desktop-only, no responsive mobile layout
- Resource IDs follow pattern: `{type}-bp{random_hex}` (e.g., `i-bp1234567890abcdef`)

## Data Model

See `data_model.md` for complete entity definitions, field types, relationships, and seed data specifications.

## Out of Scope

- **Authentication**: App starts pre-logged-in as "Zhang Wei" (admin user at Hangzhou Tech Co.)
- **Real API calls**: All data is local mock data in localStorage
- **File uploads**: OSS file browser shows mock objects, no real upload
- **Real-time monitoring**: CloudMonitor shows static mock charts
- **RAM (Resource Access Management)**: No user/role/policy management UI
- **Marketplace**: No third-party product catalog
