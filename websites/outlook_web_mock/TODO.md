> Status: READY FOR DEV
> Last updated by: plan agent, 2025-03-09
> Research: `assets/README.md` | Data model: `assets/data_model.md`

## Status Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Done

---

## P0 — Core Shell

Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first.

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest outlook_web_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react` (for icons). Clean out boilerplate.

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/` — replicate the **New Outlook (2024)** design. Exact specs:
  - Primary: `#0078D4` (Microsoft Blue)
  - Background: `#FFFFFF` (white main), `#F3F3F3` (sidebar/folder pane bg), `#F5F5F5` (top bar bg)
  - Text: `#323130` (primary), `#605E5C` (secondary/meta), `#A19F9D` (muted)
  - Borders: `#EDEBE9`
  - Selected row: `#EBF3FC`, Hover row: `#F3F2F1`
  - Danger: `#D13438`, Success: `#107C10`
  - Category colors: Blue `#0078D4`, Green `#107C10`, Orange `#FF8C00`, Purple `#8764B8`, Red `#D13438`, Yellow `#FFB900`
  - Font: `"Segoe UI", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Roboto", sans-serif`
  - Sizes: 14px body, 12px meta/secondary, 16px section headings, 20px page titles
  - Weights: 400 regular, 600 semibold (unread senders/subjects, active nav items)
  - Border-radius: 4px buttons/inputs, 50% avatars
  - Spacing: 4px base grid (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48)

- [x] **App layout** (see `assets/screenshots/inbox_01.jpg` and `inbox_05.jpg`): Three-zone horizontal layout:
  - **Top bar**: Full width, 48px height, `#F5F5F5` bg. Left: hamburger menu icon (☰, toggles folder pane) + "Outlook" text logo. Center: search input bar (~400px, rounded corners, magnifying glass icon, placeholder "Search"). Right: bell/notification icon, settings gear icon ⚙️, help "?" icon, user avatar circle (36px, initials on colored bg).
  - **Left navigation rail**: 48px wide, full height below top bar, `#F3F3F3` bg. Vertical icon column: Mail (envelope), Calendar (calendar grid), People (person silhouette) icons, stacked vertically with 8px gaps, each 40x40px clickable area with hover highlight. Active icon has blue `#0078D4` accent (left border or filled icon).
  - **Main content area**: Remaining space right of nav rail, below top bar. Contents change per module (Mail, Calendar, People).

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`. Routes:
  - `/` → redirect to `/mail/inbox`
  - `/mail` → redirect to `/mail/inbox`
  - `/mail/:folderId` → Mail module, selected folder
  - `/mail/:folderId/:messageId` → Mail module, selected message
  - `/calendar` → Calendar module (default month view)
  - `/calendar/:view` → Calendar module with specific view (day/workweek/week/month)
  - `/people` → People/Contacts module
  - `/people/:contactId` → People module, selected contact
  - `/go` → State inspection endpoint (JSON view)

- [x] **State management**: `AppContext.jsx` + `dataManager.js`. AppContext wraps entire app, provides:
  - `state` — full application state object
  - `dispatch` or setter functions for all state mutations
  - `dataManager.js` exports `createInitialData()` (see `assets/data_model.md` for full structure) and all CRUD helpers
  - State persisted to localStorage under key `"outlook_web_mock_state"`
  - On mount: load from localStorage or call `createInitialData()`

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` + route. Renders JSON with `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. Must track initial state snapshot at first load and compute diff on each render.

- [x] **Session isolation**: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin:
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with `{ action: "set", state: {...} }` — sets both initial + current state
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with `{ action: "set_current", state: {...} }` — updates current state only
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with `{ action: "reset" }` — resets to initial state
  - `GET /go?sid=<sid>` → returns `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`
  - Session state stored in-memory on server side, keyed by `sid`

## P1 — Mail Module (Primary Feature Set)

### Folder Pane

- [x] **Folder pane** (~220px wide, left of message list, right of nav rail, collapsible via hamburger icon in top bar):
  - Top: "New Mail" button — blue primary button (`#0078D4`, white text, 36px height, full width minus padding, mail+ icon left of text). Clicking opens compose modal.
  - **Favorites section** (collapsible with chevron ▸/▾): Shows folders with `isFavorite: true`. Each row: 32px height, 12px left indent, folder icon (16px) + name + unread badge (right-aligned, blue pill with count if > 0). Hover: `#F3F2F1` bg. Click: navigate to that folder, highlight row with `#EBF3FC`.
  - **Account section** (collapsible, header = user email address with chevron): All folders in hierarchy. Same row styling. System folders in order: Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items, Deleted Items, Junk Email, Archive. Custom folders after.

### Reading Pane

    - Subject line: 20px, semibold `600`, `#323130`, top of pane with 16px padding
    - Category chips: colored pill badges below subject (if message has categories)

  - **Send behavior**: On send → move compose draft to `sentitems` folder as a new sent message, clear compose state, return to reading pane. Show brief "Message sent" toast notification at bottom.
  - **Discard behavior**: Show confirmation dialog "Discard this message?", on confirm → close compose, on cancel → return to compose.
  - **Draft auto-save**: When compose is open and user navigates away, auto-save to Drafts folder.

## P2 — Secondary Features

Implement these after P1 is solid, for depth and realism.

- [ ] **Drag & drop messages to folders**: Dragging a message from message list onto a folder in folder pane → moves message to that folder. Folder highlights on drag-over.

- [x] **Right-click context menu** on messages: Context menu popup with items: Open, Reply, Reply All, Forward, Delete, Archive, Move to → (submenu with folders), Mark as read/unread, Flag, Categorize → (submenu with categories), Pin/Unpin.

- [ ] **Multi-select messages**: Clicking checkbox on message row toggles selection without opening reading pane. When multiple selected, reading pane shows "N messages selected" with bulk action buttons: Delete, Move, Mark read, Mark unread, Flag, Categorize, Archive.

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** (subset):
  - `N` → New message compose

- [ ] **Notification bell**: Clicking bell icon in top bar → dropdown showing recent activity/notifications (can be a static mock list: "3 new messages in Inbox", "Meeting in 15 minutes: Team Standup"). Badge with count on bell icon.

- [ ] **Quick settings panel**: Alternative to full settings modal. Clicking settings gear → small flyout panel from right side (~300px wide) with quick toggles: Theme, Density, Reading pane position. "View all Outlook settings" link at bottom → opens full settings modal.

- [ ] **Dark mode**: CSS custom properties / data-theme approach. When `settings.theme === "dark"`:
  - Background: `#1F1F1F`, Surface: `#2D2D2D`, Text: `#E0E0E0`
  - Sidebar: `#292929`, Selected: `#0078D4` with opacity, Borders: `#404040`
  - Apply to all components globally via CSS variables

- [ ] **Calendar event drag to resize/move**: In week/day views, drag event block to change its time. Drag bottom edge to resize duration. (Complex; implement if time allows.)

- [ ] **Contact favorites**: Star/favorite toggle on contacts. "Frequent contacts" filter in People sidebar.

- [ ] **Email conversation threading**: When `conversationView` setting is on, group messages with same `conversationId` together in message list. Show as expandable thread — click to expand/collapse individual messages within thread.

## Out of Scope

Dev must NOT implement these:

- Authentication / login / logout (app starts pre-logged-in as `Katy Reid`)
- Real email send/receive over network
- OAuth, SSO, or identity verification
- File uploads to real servers (attachments are mock metadata only)
- Multiple account switching
- Real-time notifications / WebSocket push
- Database persistence (beyond localStorage)
- Email encryption / S/MIME
- Advanced mail rules engine (just UI for viewing)
- Microsoft Teams integration (just show "Online meeting" label)
- OneNote / To-Do deep integration (just nav icons)
