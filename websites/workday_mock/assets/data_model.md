```javascript
return {
  currentUser,          // §CurrentUser
  employees,            // §Employees (8-10 records)
  departments,          // §Departments (5 records) — NEW
  timeEntries,          // §TimeEntries (10-15 records)
  timeOffRequests,      // §TimeOffRequests (4-5 records)
  timeOffBalance,       // §TimeOffBalance
  payroll,              // §Payroll (6 records)
  benefits,             // §Benefits (with 3-4 plans, 1-2 dependents)
  reviews,              // §Reviews (2-3 records)
  goals,                // §Goals (3-4 records) — NEW

  announcements,        // §Announcements (4-5 records)
  notifications,        // §Notifications (5-6 records) — NEW
  clockStatus,          // §ClockStatus
};
```

### New entities to add (vs. current mock):
- `departments` — for directory filtering and org structure
- `goals` — for performance management CRUD
- `notifications` — for notification bell dropdown
- Expanded `benefits` with `dependents` array and richer `plans`
- Expanded `payroll` with line-item deductions
- Expanded `tasks` with `comments`, `initiator`, `businessProcess`, `priority`
- Expanded `currentUser` with `phone`, `employeeType`, `compensationGrade`, `annualSalary`
- Expanded `employees` with `birthday`, `phone`

### Normalizer updates needed:
Add normalizers for: `departments`, `goals`, `notifications`, `benefits.dependents`
Update existing normalizers: `normalizeEmployee` (add phone, birthday), `normalizePaystub` (add line items), `normalizeTask` (add comments, priority, businessProcess)
