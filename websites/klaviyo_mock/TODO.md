## P0 — Core Shell

- [x] Project scaffold: `npm create vite@latest klaviyo_mock -- --template react`, install deps (`react-router-dom`). No Tailwind — use plain CSS to match Klaviyo's clean SaaS aesthetic.

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/dashboard_overview.jpg` and `assets/screenshots/campaigns_dashboard.jpg`. The design uses a clean, minimal SaaS style. Exact values:
  - **Primary background:** `#FFFFFF` (cards, sidebar)
  - **Page background:** `#F7F7F8` (light gray behind cards)
  - **Primary text:** `#1A1A1A`
  - **Secondary text:** `#6B6B6B`
  - **Klaviyo brand:** `#000000` (logo/wordmark)
  - **Active nav text/indicator:** `#0066FF` (blue, with light blue-tinted left border bar on active sidebar item)
  - **Success/Good badge:** `#28A745` text on `#E8F5E9` background
  - **Danger/negative %:** `#DC3545`
  - **Positive %:** `#28A745`
  - **Borders:** `#E5E5E5`
  - **Card shadow:** `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`
  - **Font family:** `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif`
  - **Font sizes:** Page title 24px bold, card title 16px semibold, body 14px, small/label 12px
  - **Sidebar width:** 220px
  - **Border radius:** 8px for cards, 4px for inputs/buttons

- [x] **App layout** (see `assets/screenshots/dashboard_overview.jpg`): Fixed left sidebar (220px wide, full viewport height, white background, left-aligned). Top area of sidebar: "klaviyo" wordmark logo (~28px font, black, with trademark superscript dot). Below logo: search input (full sidebar width minus padding, gray border, magnifying glass icon, placeholder "Search", hint "Cmd+K"). Below search: vertical nav items. Main content area fills remaining width with `#F7F7F8` background, 32px padding. No separate top bar — Klaviyo uses the sidebar as primary navigation with only a subtle top-right area for notifications/support on some pages.

- [x] **Sidebar navigation items** (from screenshots, top to bottom):
  1. **Home** — house icon, route `/`
  2. **Campaigns** — play-triangle icon, route `/campaigns`
  3. **Flows** — branch/fork icon, route `/flows`
  4. **Sign-up forms** — clipboard/form icon, route `/signup-forms`
  5. **Audience** — people/group icon, expandable section:
     - Lists & segments → `/audience/lists-segments`
     - Profiles → `/audience/profiles`
  6. **Content** — pencil/edit icon, expandable section:
     - Templates → `/content/templates`
     - Images & Brand → `/content/brand`
  7. **Analytics** — chart-bar icon, expandable section:
     - Dashboards → `/analytics/dashboards`
     - Metrics → `/analytics/metrics`
     - Benchmarks → `/analytics/benchmarks`
  - **Bottom of sidebar:** Account section — small avatar circle (initials), account name "Acme Store", user email below. Clicking opens account dropdown.
  - Active item: blue text + blue 3px left border bar + light blue-tinted background
  - Hover: light gray background `#F5F5F5`
  - Expandable sections: chevron icon rotates on expand, sub-items indented ~16px

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`. Routes: `/` (Home), `/campaigns` (CampaignList), `/campaigns/new` (CampaignCreate), `/campaigns/:id` (CampaignDetail), `/flows` (FlowList), `/flows/:id` (FlowBuilder), `/signup-forms` (SignupFormList), `/audience/lists-segments` (AudienceLists), `/audience/profiles` (ProfileList), `/audience/profiles/:id` (ProfileDetail), `/content/templates` (TemplateList), `/content/brand` (BrandSettings), `/analytics/dashboards` (AnalyticsDashboard), `/analytics/metrics` (MetricsList), `/analytics/benchmarks` (Benchmarks), `/go` (StateInspector)

- [x] **State management**: `AppContext.jsx` + `utils/dataManager.js`. `dataManager.js` exports `createInitialData()` returning all entities as defined in `assets/data_model.md`. Context provides `state`, `dispatch`, and helper functions for CRUD on each entity. Persist to `localStorage` under key `"klaviyo_mock_state"`.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` + route. Returns JSON with `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. Computes diff by deep-comparing initial vs current state, showing added/modified/removed items per entity type.

- [x] **Session isolation**: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin. `POST /post?sid=<sid>` accepts `{ action: "set"|"set_current"|"reset", state: {...} }`. `GET /go?sid=<sid>` returns `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. `GET /state?sid=<sid>` returns current state. Session state stored in memory on dev server, keyed by `sid`.
