## What to Skip (Out of Scope)
- Authentication / login / signup (app starts pre-logged-in)
- Real-time collaboration cursors (too complex for mock)
- AI features (Miro AI, content generation)
- Video calls on board
- File upload to real servers
- Integration with external tools (Jira, Slack, etc.)
- Mobile interface (desktop only)
- Presentation recording (Talktracks)
- Complex template editing
- Pen/freehand drawing (canvas drawing is complex to implement realistically)
