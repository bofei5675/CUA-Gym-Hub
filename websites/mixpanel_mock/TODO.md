## P0 -- Core Shell

- [x] Project scaffold: `npm create vite@latest mixpanel_mock -- --template react`, install deps (`react-router-dom`, `recharts` for charts, `lucide-react` for icons). Use plain CSS (no Tailwind). All colors/spacing per DESIGN.md.

- [x] App layout -- three-region shell: (1) Left sidebar 220px wide, white bg, right border 1px `#E8E8EC`, full viewport height, scrollable middle section; (2) Top header bar 48px tall, full width minus sidebar, white bg, bottom border 1px `#E8E8EC`; (3) Main content area fills remaining space, `#FFFFFF` bg, 24px horizontal / 20px vertical padding. The sidebar collapses to 48px icon-only mode (Mixpanel X logo, magnifying glass, home, data, boards icons) when collapse arrow is clicked. See reference screenshots `botubot_0003.webp` through `botubot_0050.webp` for exact layout.

- [x] Left sidebar content (top to bottom): (a) Project switcher row -- Mixpanel X logo (purple, ~20px), project name "SLMobbin" bold 14px, subtitle "All Project Data" muted 12px, down-chevron; (b) "+ Create New" button -- full width, purple `#7B5CFF` bg, white text, 6px border-radius, 10px 20px padding, chevron dropdown on right that opens create menu (see P1); (c) Search row -- magnifying glass icon + "Search" text + "Cmd+K" badge right-aligned, 14px, muted text `#6B6B80`, clicking opens search modal; (d) Navigation items -- Home (house icon), Data (database icon, expandable with children: Events, Users, Lexicon, Session Replay); (e) Sections with collapsible headers in uppercase 11px 600 weight `#6B6B80` with 0.08em letter-spacing: "FAVORITES" (boards list), "PINNED" (rocket emoji + "Starter Board", other pinned boards), "YOUR BOARDS" (boards list); (f) Bottom bar -- 4 icon buttons horizontally: apps grid, help circle with orange dot, settings gear, collapse/expand arrow. Each nav item: 36px height, 8px 12px padding, 6px border-radius, hover `#F7F7F8`, active purple bg `#F3F0FF` + bold text + `#1A1A2E` color. "Upgrade Plan" banner with yellow bg `#F5A623` at sidebar bottom above icon bar.

- [x] Top header bar: Left side shows breadcrumb "SLMobbin / [Current Page Name]" in 14px, project name is a link. Right side shows action buttons depending on context -- on Board pages: Subscribe, Share, heart (favorite), link icon, "..." more menu; on Report pages: link icon, "..." more menu, purple "Save" button. The "..." menu is a dropdown with: Duplicate, Undo (Cmd+Z), New Report, Alerts, Export (submenu), Refresh Data (with "Data from X min ago" subtitle).

- [x] Date picker bar (44px): Sits below the header on Board and Report pages. Left side: calendar icon + date range text (e.g., "Jan 16, 2026 -- Jan 22, 2026"); Center: time preset pills in a row -- Custom, Today, Yesterday, 7D, 30D, 3M, 6M, 12M -- each pill is 4px 12px padding, 4px border-radius, 13px font; active pill has purple bg `#7B5CFF` + white text, inactive has transparent bg; "Default" pill with border; Right side: "Exclude" dropdown + "+" button. On report pages additionally: granularity dropdown ("Day" with chevron, dropdown shows Minute/Hour/Day/Week/Month/Quarter), chart type dropdown (icon + "Line" with chevron, dropdown shows Line/Bar/Pie options).

- [x] Routing in App.jsx with BrowserRouter. Routes: `/` (Home/redirect to first board), `/board/:boardId` (Board view), `/report/:reportId` (Report view -- Insights/Funnels/Flows/Retention), `/events` (Events stream), `/users` (Users list), `/lexicon` (Lexicon data dictionary), `/lexicon/:section` (Lexicon sub-pages: events/eventProperties/profileProperties/cohorts/customEvents/metrics/behaviors/dataDeletion), `/session-replay` (Session Replay), `/settings` (Settings), `/settings/:tab` (Settings sub-tabs: org/project/profile), `/go` (state inspector).

- [x] State management: React Context (`AppContext`) wrapping entire app. `dataManager.js` with `createInitialData()` returning full state per `data_model.md`. State stored in localStorage with key `mixpanel_mock_state`. Initial state snapshot saved separately for diff calculation. Provide `getState()`, `setState()`, `resetState()` helpers.

- [x] `/go` endpoint: `src/pages/Go.jsx` that returns JSON `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}` where state_diff is a deep comparison showing only changed fields. Render as formatted JSON in a `<pre>` tag.

- [x] Session isolation: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin handling `POST /post?sid=<sid>` (set/reset state for session) and `GET /state?sid=<sid>` (get state). `GET /go?sid=<sid>` returns `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`. When `sid` param is present, use session-specific localStorage key `mixpanel_mock_state_<sid>`. On `set` action, write both `.initial` and `.current` keys; on `set_current`, write only `.current`; on `reset`, restore `.current` from `.initial`.

## P1 -- Primary Features

### Boards (Dashboard View)

- [x] Board page (`/board/:boardId`): Displays the board title as a large heading (28px 700 weight), editable on click (inline text input); below it, description text (14px 400, muted color), also editable. Below the title area is a grid of report cards. Each card has: 8px border-radius, 1px `#E8E8EC` border, white bg, 20px internal padding, card title (16px 600), a mini-chart visualization (simplified version of the full report chart rendered with recharts), and a "..." hover menu. Cards are arranged in a responsive grid. Below all cards: "+ Add content" placeholder area.

- [x] Board card mini-charts: For Insights report cards, render a simplified line/bar chart using recharts with the report's `chartData`. For Funnels cards, render a horizontal bar showing steps with purple (converted) and green/gray (drop-off) segments. For Flows cards, show a simplified Sankey-like diagram. For text items, render the text content with basic rich text formatting (bold, italic, links). For Retention cards, show a mini retention curve.

- [x] Board "+ Add content" menu: Clicking the "+" button or "+ Add content" area opens a dropdown menu with items: "Launch Spark (Beta)" with sparkle icon + "Use natural language to generate reports with AI" subtitle, "Existing Report" + "Start from a previously saved report", "Insights Report" + "Explore product usage in detail", "Funnels Report" + "Analyze conversion and drop-off", "Flows Report" + "Understand steps in the user journey", "Retention Report" + "Measure product stickiness", "Heatmap" + "Explore interactions by users", "Text" + "Use text to tell a story", "Media" + "Upload an image or embed a video". Each item has an icon (matching the report type icons from the reference screenshots). Clicking an item creates a new board item and navigates to the report editor or adds a text block inline.

- [x] Board text blocks: Inline rich text editing with a floating toolbar that appears on selection -- toolbar has: text size dropdown (T with down arrow), bulleted list, Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, highlight, link, more options. Text blocks support paragraph text with links (link insertion shows URL input + "Link" button in purple). Each text block has a "..." menu on hover (right side) and a "+" button below to add more content.

### Insights Report

- [x] Insights report page (`/report/:reportId` where report.type === "insights"): Three-panel layout: left sidebar (navigation, same as shell), center area (chart + table), right query panel (300px, white bg, left border 1px `#E8E8EC`). The right panel has 3 tabs at top: "Query" (active, underlined purple), "Chart", "Annotations". Below tabs: 5 icon buttons in a row for chart sub-types (line chart grid, bar chart, horizontal bar, funnel, dots grid).

- [x] Insights query panel -- Metrics section: Header "Metrics" with "+" button on right. Each metric row has: a colored letter label (A, B, C) in a circle matching the series color, a gear icon, metric name text (e.g., "Uniques of All Events"), expandable to show: event selector (colored dot + event name like "All Events" with "Add Event" link below), measurement dropdown (shows "# User > Uniques - Cumulative Users" with "Cumulative Sum" tag that can be removed). "Add Metric" button at bottom. See screenshot `botubot_0050.webp` for measurement dropdown showing: Unique Users (selected, purple bg), Total Events, Total Sessions, Frequency per User (with chevron for sub-options), Aggregate Property (with chevron), Aggregate Property per User (with chevron).

- [x] Insights query panel -- Filter section: Header "Filter" with "+" button. Each filter shows: property type icon (Aa for string, # for number), property name (e.g., "Country"), operator text (e.g., "Is"), value(s) (e.g., "Singapore or United States"), vertical "..." menu. Clicking "+" opens a property picker dropdown with search, categorized by All/Event/User/Computed tabs.

- [x] Insights query panel -- Breakdown section: Header "Breakdown" with "+" button. Each breakdown shows: property type icon, property name (e.g., "device type*"), vertical "..." menu. Clicking "+" opens property picker (same as filter).

- [x] Insights chart area: Renders a recharts line/bar/pie chart using the report's `chartData`. Above chart: legend row showing colored squares + series name labels (truncated with "...") + "+N More" link if many series. Chart has Y-axis labels on left (e.g., "E100", "E80", "E40"), X-axis date labels at bottom. Below chart: 3 icon buttons for chart density/view toggle (compact, medium, wide table icons). Hovering a point on the chart shows a tooltip with exact values. Annotations appear as small numbered circles on the X-axis (clicking shows annotation text).

- [x] Insights data table: Below the chart. Has a search bar on left and "Dynamic Segments" dropdown on right. Table columns: Metric (with colored dot), breakdown property columns (with sort chevrons and "Top 12" dropdowns), Average column (sortable, default sort descending), date columns. Rows show metric name, breakdown values (cohort name with colored dot), and numeric values. Table header row has `#F7F7F8` bg, 13px 500 weight text. Rows are 48px height with bottom border `#E8E8EC`, hover bg `#F9F9FB`.

- [x] Insights chart type switching: Clicking the chart type dropdown in the date picker bar or the sub-type icons in the query panel changes the visualization. Support at minimum: line chart, bar/column chart, and table view. The chart rerenders with the same data in the new format.

- [x] Insights date range interaction: Clicking a time preset pill (7D, 30D, etc.) updates the date range text, recalculates the visible chart data, and highlights the active pill. Clicking "Custom" opens a date range picker modal. Changing granularity (Day/Week/Month) regroups the data.

### Funnels Report

- [x] Funnels report page (`/report/:reportId` where report.type === "funnels"): Same three-panel layout. Right query panel shows "Steps" section (instead of Metrics) with lettered steps (A, B) each showing event name and "N Steps before, N Steps after" with chevron. "CONVERSION CRITERIA" section with time window (e.g., "Within 30 hours") and counting method ("Uniques"). Filter and Breakdown sections same as Insights. Main area shows waterfall-style funnel visualization: vertical bars for each step, purple bars = Did Not Convert, green bars = Converted, gray bars = Drop-off. Between steps: "+" buttons to add intermediate steps. Each step shows: step label (A, A+1, A+2...), event name, conversion percentage + count, drop-off percentage + count. Legend at top: purple square "Did Not Convert", green square "Converted". See screenshot `botubot_0016.webp`.

### Events View

## Out of Scope

- Authentication / login (app starts pre-logged-in as "Sam Lee", owner of "SLMobbin" organization)
- Real event tracking SDK integration
- Actual session replay video recording/playback (use static placeholder screenshots in the player area)
- Real heatmap rendering (show static overlay image)
- Data pipeline / export to external storage
- Billing / payment processing (show UI but buttons are non-functional)
- Real-time data ingestion or WebSocket connections
- CSV/data import functionality (show modal UI but import action is non-functional)
- Email/notification sending for alerts and subscriptions
