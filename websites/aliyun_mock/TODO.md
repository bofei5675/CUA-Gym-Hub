- [~] In progress
- [x] Done

## P0 -- Core Shell

<!-- Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] Project scaffold: `npm create vite@latest aliyun_mock -- --template react` inside this directory, install deps (`react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`). Ensure `vite.config.js` has the mock-api plugin for session isolation (see aws_console_mock or slack_mock for reference pattern).

- [x] App layout (see DESIGN.md for all measurements): fixed top navbar 50px height, dark background `#232F3E`, full width. Left sidebar 200px width, white background `#FFFFFF`, border-right `1px solid #E8E8E8`, fixed position below top nav, collapsible to 48px icon rail. Main content area fills remaining space with `margin-left: 200px; margin-top: 50px; padding: 24px; background: #F5F5F5; min-height: calc(100vh - 50px)`. When sidebar collapsed, main content shifts to `margin-left: 48px`.

- [x] Top navigation bar (left to right): (1) Grid/hamburger icon button -- opens product catalog drawer overlay; (2) Alibaba Cloud logo in orange `#FF6A00` -- links to console home `/`; (3) Current service name as breadcrumb text (e.g., "Elastic Compute Service"); (4) Region selector dropdown -- displays current region name (e.g., "China (Hangzhou)"), clicking opens dropdown list of all 10 regions from data_model.md, selecting a region updates `currentRegion` in state and filters all resource lists; (5) Search input centered, ~400px wide, placeholder "Search products and resources...", on submit navigates to matching service page or filters resources; (6) Notification bell icon with red badge showing unread message count from state; (7) "Billing" text link -- navigates to `/billing`; (8) "Support" text link (no-op); (9) User avatar circle with first letter of displayName + dropdown on click showing: account name, account ID, a divider, and non-functional "Sign Out" option.

- [x] Left sidebar navigation: changes based on current route/service. Each service has its own sidebar menu config. Sidebar items use DESIGN.md `.sidebar-item` styles -- active item has blue left border and blue text. Groups have collapsible headers (`.sidebar-group-title`). Sidebar has a collapse/expand toggle button at the bottom (chevron icon). Sidebar configs per service:
  - **Console Home** (`/`): "Overview", "Favorites", "Recent Products"
  - **ECS** (`/ecs/*`): "Instances", "Disks", "Images", "Security Groups", "Key Pairs", "Network Interfaces"
  - **OSS** (`/oss/*`): "Buckets", "Cross-Region Replication", "Data Processing"
  - **RDS** (`/rds/*`): "Instances", "Backups", "Parameter Groups", "Security"
  - **VPC** (`/vpc/*`): "VPCs", "VSwitches", "Route Tables", "NAT Gateways"
  - **SLB** (`/slb/*`): "Instances", "Certificates"
  - **Billing** (`/billing/*`): "Overview", "Bills", "Orders", "Coupons"
  - **CloudMonitor** (`/monitor/*`): "Dashboard", "Alarms", "Event Monitoring"

- [x] Routing in App.jsx with BrowserRouter. Routes:
  - `/` -- Console Home Dashboard
  - `/ecs` -- redirects to `/ecs/instances`
  - `/ecs/instances` -- ECS instance list
  - `/ecs/instances/:id` -- ECS instance detail (tabbed)
  - `/ecs/disks` -- Disk list
  - `/ecs/security-groups` -- Security group list
  - `/ecs/security-groups/:id` -- Security group rules
  - `/ecs/images` -- Image list (read-only)
  - `/ecs/key-pairs` -- Key pair list (read-only)
  - `/oss` -- redirects to `/oss/buckets`
  - `/oss/buckets` -- OSS bucket list
  - `/oss/buckets/:name` -- OSS bucket detail (tabbed: Overview, Files, Settings)
  - `/rds` -- redirects to `/rds/instances`
  - `/rds/instances` -- RDS instance list
  - `/rds/instances/:id` -- RDS instance detail
  - `/vpc` -- redirects to `/vpc/list`
  - `/vpc/list` -- VPC list
  - `/vpc/vswitches` -- VSwitch list
  - `/slb` -- redirects to `/slb/instances`
  - `/slb/instances` -- SLB instance list
  - `/billing` -- redirects to `/billing/overview`
  - `/billing/overview` -- Billing dashboard
  - `/billing/bills` -- Bill list
  - `/monitor` -- redirects to `/monitor/alarms`
  - `/monitor/alarms` -- Alarm list
  - `/go` -- State inspector page

- [x] State management: React Context (`AppContext.jsx`) wrapping the app. `dataManager.js` implements `createInitialData()` returning the full data structure from `data_model.md`. State stored in localStorage keyed by `aliyun_mock_state`. Context provides `state` and `dispatch` (or setState wrapper). All CRUD operations go through context to ensure `/go` can diff.

- [x] `/go` endpoint: `src/pages/Go.jsx` renders JSON of `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. `state_diff` is a deep diff showing only changed/added/removed fields. Route: `/go`.

- [x] Session isolation: `vite.config.js` configures a plugin that intercepts:
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with body `{"action":"set","state":{...}}` -- sets both initial and current state for session
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with body `{"action":"set_current","state":{...}}` -- updates only current state
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with body `{"action":"reset"}` -- resets current to initial
  - `GET /go?sid=<sid>` -- returns `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`
  Follow the exact pattern from `aws_console_mock/vite.config.js` or any other existing mock.

- [x] Product catalog drawer: when user clicks the grid icon (top-left of nav bar), an overlay panel slides down from beneath the top nav. Overlay background `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45)`. Panel is white, max-height 70vh, scrollable. Products organized in a grid by category (see DESIGN.md section 9 for categories). Each product item shows an icon and name, is clickable to navigate to that service route. Star icon on each item toggles favorite status in state. Close by clicking outside or pressing Escape.

## P1 -- Primary Features

<!-- Core features a user interacts with in the first 5 minutes. -->

### Console Home Dashboard (`/`)

- [x] Welcome banner: card at top with "Welcome, Zhang Wei" greeting, account ID, and balance display (`CNY 12,586.42` in orange). "Top Up" button (primary orange, no-op).

- [x] Resource summary cards row: 4 cards in a horizontal row, each showing an icon, count, and label. Cards: "ECS Instances" (count of all ECS instances in current region), "OSS Buckets" (count), "RDS Instances" (count), "SLB Instances" (count). Each card is clickable, navigates to the corresponding service list page.

- [x] Billing snapshot card: shows "Current Month Spend" with the current month's amount from `billing.monthlySpend[0]`. Small bar chart or sparkline showing last 6 months trend (use simple CSS bars, no charting library needed). "View Details" link navigates to `/billing/overview`.

- [x] Favorite products section: horizontal list of favorite products from `favoriteProducts` array. Each shows icon + name, clickable to navigate. An "Edit" button opens inline editing to remove favorites (X icon on each).

- [x] Notification/message panel: show count of unread messages as badge on bell icon in top nav. Clicking bell opens a small dropdown panel (positioned below the bell icon, right-aligned, width ~360px, max-height 400px, shadow per DESIGN.md). Panel shows list of messages from `messages` array: each shows type icon (color-coded: blue for system, orange for billing, red for security), title (bold if unread), relative timestamp. Clicking a message marks it as read (updates `isRead: true` in state) and could open a detail or just mark-and-close. "Mark All Read" link at top of panel.

### ECS Instance List (`/ecs/instances`)

- [x] Page header: "Instances" title on left, "Create Instance" primary orange button on right (opens create instance wizard modal, see P2). Breadcrumb above: "Console Home > ECS > Instances".

Breadcrumb: "Console Home > ECS > Instances > [instance name]".

- [x] Tab navigation (see DESIGN.md section 12): tabs are "Instance Details", "Monitoring", "Security Groups", "Cloud Disks", "Snapshots" (placeholder).

- [x] **Instance Details tab** (default): Two-column key-value grid in a card. Left column: Instance Name, Instance ID (monospace + copy button), Status, Region, Zone, Instance Type, vCPU / Memory, Image, OS Name, Creation Time. Right column: VPC ID (blue link), VSwitch ID, Security Group IDs (blue links), Private IP, Public IP, Key Pair Name, Billing Method, Auto-Renewal Status, Expiry Time.

Each card shows the metric name, current value, and a fake static chart line. Time range selector at top: "1 Hour", "6 Hours", "1 Day", "7 Days" (toggling these just updates a label, chart stays static).

- [x] **Security Groups tab**: table listing the security groups associated with this instance (`securityGroupIds`). Columns: Group Name/ID (link to `/ecs/security-groups/:id`), Description, Rule Count, VPC ID. "Add to Security Group" button (opens a select dropdown of available groups, confirming adds the group ID to the instance's `securityGroupIds` array).

## Out of Scope

<!-- Dev must NOT implement these. -->

- Authentication / login (app starts pre-logged-in as "Zhang Wei" with admin role at "Hangzhou Tech Co.")
- Real API calls or network requests (all data is mock, in localStorage)
- File uploads to real servers (OSS upload creates mock entries only)
- Real-time monitoring data (charts show static mock data)
- RAM (Resource Access Management) user/role/policy management
- Marketplace / third-party products
- International site vs China site switching (mock is English-only)
- SSL certificate management
- DNS / Domain registration
- Container service (ACK) management
- Serverless / Function Compute
- Real clipboard API for copy buttons (use `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with try-catch fallback)
