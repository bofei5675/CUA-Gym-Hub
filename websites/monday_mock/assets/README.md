# Monday.com Mock — Research Summary

## App Overview

**Monday.com** is a cloud-based Work Operating System (Work OS) that enables teams to build custom workflows for managing projects, tasks, and everyday work. It is a highly visual, colorful, and flexible platform where the primary data abstraction is the **board** — a customizable spreadsheet-like table with rows (items), column groups (groups), and typed columns (status, people, dates, numbers, etc.).

Monday.com serves 225,000+ customers across 200+ industries. Its core strength is the combination of a structured data table with colorful, visual status indicators and multiple view types (Table, Kanban, Timeline/Gantt, Calendar, Chart, Dashboard).

## Key User Personas

1. **Project Manager (Sarah)** — Manages multiple project boards, assigns tasks to team members, tracks timelines and deadlines, monitors status across groups. Primary workflows: creating items, changing statuses, assigning people, setting timelines.

2. **Team Member (Alex)** — Views assigned tasks, updates item statuses, adds comments/updates to items, tracks personal workload. Primary workflows: filtering "My Items", updating status columns, writing updates.

3. **Department Lead (Mike)** — Oversees multiple boards/workspaces, uses dashboards for high-level views, reviews progress across teams. Primary workflows: navigating between boards, using dashboards, filtering/sorting.

## Core Architecture: The Board Model

Monday.com's data hierarchy is:

```
Workspace
  └── Folder (optional)
       └── Board
            └── Group (colored section header)
                 └── Item (row)
                      ├── Column Values (cells)
                      ├── Subitems
                      └── Updates (comments/activity)
```
