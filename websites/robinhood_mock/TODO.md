# Robinhood Mock — TODO

> **Status:** READY FOR DEV
> **Last updated by:** plan agent, March 2025
> **Research:** `assets/README.md` | **Data model:** `assets/data_model.md`
> **Existing scaffold:** Project already has Vite+React+Tailwind, store, basic pages — improve/replace, don't start from scratch.

## Status Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Done

## Important Context

The project already has a partial scaffold with:
- `vite.config.js` — Full mock-api plugin (POST /post, GET /state, GET /go, /upload, /files) ✅ Keep as-is
- `package.json` — Dependencies (react, recharts, lucide-react, date-fns, tailwind) ✅ Keep as-is
- `tailwind.config.js` — Color scheme defined ✅ Keep, may extend
- `src/lib/store.jsx` — Context provider with placeOrder, toggleWatchlist, live price simulation ✅ Extend
- `src/lib/mockData.js` — createDefaultState, normalization, state diff ✅ Major expansion needed
- `src/components/Layout.jsx` — Sidebar nav + search + top bar ✅ Redesign to match Robinhood
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — Basic portfolio chart + watchlist ✅ Major enhancement needed
- `src/pages/StockDetail.jsx` — Basic chart + order form ✅ Major enhancement needed
- `src/pages/Portfolio.jsx` — Holdings table + pie chart ✅ Enhancement needed
- `src/pages/History.jsx` — Transaction history (exists but needs verification)
- `src/pages/Go.jsx` — State inspector ✅ Keep

**Strategy: Enhance existing files rather than replacing wholesale.** Fix the layout to match real Robinhood, expand data, and add missing interactions.

## P0 — Core Shell & Layout Fix

<!-- Without these, the app doesn't look or feel like Robinhood. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] **Visual design system alignment**: Redesigned Layout.jsx with horizontal top navigation bar, feather logo left, centered search bar, right-aligned nav links (Home, Portfolio, Cash, Notifications bell, Account avatar). Mobile bottom tab bar added. Sidebar removed.

- [x] **Header bar redesign**: Top header bar implemented with feather logo SVG, search input with dropdown results, nav links, bell icon with notification dropdown, account avatar. Mobile responsive.

- [x] **Routing expansion**: Added /account, /notifications, /crypto (placeholder), /transfers (placeholder) routes. All routes within Layout.

- [x] **Data expansion in mockData.js**: Expanded to 14 stocks with full data (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, NFLX, AMD, SPY, QQQ, DIS, COIN, PYPL). Each has complete stats, about text, tags, analystRating, earnings. Added 6 portfolio holdings, 12 transactions, 8 news articles, 5 alerts, 8-item watchlist.

- [x] **Store context expansion**: Added addToWatchlist, removeFromWatchlist, cancelOrder, markAlertRead, markAllAlertsRead, placeLimitOrder, placeStopOrder actions. Live price simulation updates portfolio value.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint client-side**: Verified working. Returns initial_state, current_state, and state_diff with full data.

## P2 — Secondary Features (Depth & Realism)

<!-- Implement only after P1 is complete and tested. -->

- [ ] **Light mode / dark mode toggle**: Real Robinhood supports both. Add a toggle in account menu or header. Update tailwind to support both color schemes. Default to dark mode. Store preference in state.

- [ ] **Crypto section**: Route `/crypto`. Show list of crypto assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, XRP, ADA) with prices and 24h change. Clicking navigates to a crypto detail page similar to stock detail. Buy/sell panel works the same way. See `data_model.md §Crypto`.

- [ ] **Recurring investments**: On stock detail page, add "Recurring Investment" option in the Order Type dropdown. Shows: amount ($), frequency (Daily, Weekly, Biweekly, Monthly), start date picker. Creates a recurring investment record in state. Show active recurring investments in a "Recurring" section on the Portfolio page.

- [ ] **Transfer funds**: Route `/transfers`. Mock deposit/withdraw flow. "Deposit" button → modal with amount input, "From" dropdown (mock bank account "Chase ****4521"), "To" Robinhood account. Confirm → adds to cash balance. "Withdraw" reverses the flow. Show transfer history list.

- [ ] **Account page**: Route `/account`. Show user profile info (name, email, account type, member since). Sections: "Investing" (account type toggle), "Notifications" (toggle switches for email/push preferences), "App Appearance" (dark/light mode toggle). Non-functional but visually realistic.

- [ ] **Popular lists / Discover section**: On home page, below news, show curated stock lists: "100 Most Popular", "Top Movers", "Upcoming Earnings", "Tech Stocks". Each list shows 3-4 stocks with prices and change %. "Show More" expands or navigates to a list detail page.

- [ ] **After-hours indicator**: On stock detail and dashboard, show a separate line for after-hours price change below the main change. E.g., "▼ $0.50 (0.03%) After-hours". Show a clock icon or "AH" label. The chart could show a dashed continuation line for after-hours.

- [ ] **Fractional shares / dollar-based orders**: In the buy form, add a toggle between "Shares" and "Dollars". When "Dollars" is selected, user enters a dollar amount and the system calculates the fractional shares. Display: "Est. Quantity: 0.57 shares".

- [ ] **Price alerts**: On stock detail page, add "Set Alert" button. Modal: choose condition ("Goes above" / "Goes below"), enter target price. Saved alerts appear in the notifications panel. When stock price crosses the threshold (checked in the live simulation interval), generate an alert notification.

- [ ] **Order status tracking**: For limit and stop orders, don't immediately fill them. Instead, mark as "pending" and check in the live price simulation interval if the price condition is met. If met, fill the order and generate a notification. Show pending orders in a "Pending Orders" section on the History page.

- [ ] **Drag-to-reorder watchlist**: Allow dragging watchlist items to reorder them. Use a simple drag handle icon on the left of each row. Update the watchlist array order in state.

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+K` or `/` to focus search. `Escape` to close modals/dropdowns. Arrow keys to navigate search results. Consider adding Robinhood-style keyboard shortcuts.
