## P0 — Core Shell

Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first.

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest booking_com_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`, `date-fns`. No Tailwind — use plain CSS to match Booking.com's pixel-precise style.

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/homepage_01.jpg` and `assets/screenshots/search_results_000005.jpg` — these are the authoritative Booking.com screenshots. Implement a global CSS file (`src/styles/global.css`) with:
  - **Color palette**: Primary dark blue `#003580` (header, review badges), Primary blue `#0071C2` (links, buttons), Search bar yellow `#FEBB02` (search bar border, star rating), Success green `#008009` (free cancellation, deals), Price strikethrough red `#CC0000`, Background `#F5F5F5`, Card white `#FFFFFF`, Text primary `#262626`, Text secondary `#6B6B6B`, Border `#E0E0E0`, Genius blue `#004CB8`
  - **Typography**: Font family: `BlinkMacSystemFont, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`. Hero heading 32px bold white, Section heading 24px bold `#262626`, Property name 16px bold `#0071C2` (link style), Body 14px `#262626`, Small/muted 12px `#6B6B6B`, Price 20px bold
  - **Spacing scale**: 4px base — 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48px
  - **Border radius**: Buttons 4px, Cards 8px, Search bar inputs 4px, Review score badge 6px 6px 6px 0 (top-left sharp on Booking.com)
  - **Shadows**: Cards `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`, Dropdowns `0 2px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`

- [x] **App layout**: Full-width layout, no sidebar. Structure:
  - Header: 60px height, full-width, `#003580` background, fixed at top
  - Nav tabs: 48px height, slightly lighter blue row, directly below header
  - Main content: Below nav, varies by page
  - Footer: Multi-column dark section at bottom
  - Max content width: 1100px centered with auto margins

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`, routes:
  - `/` — Homepage
  - `/searchresults` — Search results list
  - `/hotel/:propertyId` — Property detail page
  - `/booking/:propertyId/:roomId` — Booking/checkout form
  - `/confirmation/:bookingId` — Booking confirmation
  - `/mytrips` — My trips/bookings dashboard
  - `/saved` — Saved/wishlist properties
  - `/go` — State inspection endpoint

- [x] **State management**: `AppContext.jsx` + `dataManager.js` (see `data_model.md` for `createInitialData()` structure). Context provides: `state`, `dispatch`, and helper functions for search, filter, book, save, cancel. State stored in localStorage with key `booking_com_mock_state`.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` + route at `/go`. Returns JSON with `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`. Diff should track: search params changes, new bookings created, bookings cancelled/modified, properties viewed, properties saved/unsaved, filter changes.

- [x] **Session isolation**: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin with:
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` — set state (action: `set`, `set_current`, `reset`)
  - `GET /go?sid=<sid>` — inspect state
  - `GET /state?sid=<sid>` — alias for go
  - DataManager session helpers: `getSessionState(sid)`, `setSessionState(sid, state)`, `resetSession(sid)`

## P1 — Primary Features

Core features a user interacts with in the first 5 minutes. These constitute the main interactive workflows for agent training.

### Header & Navigation

- [x] **Global header**: 60px tall, `#003580` background, full-width. Left: "Booking.com" logo text (white "Booking" + light-blue ".com" in bold 24px, clickable → `/`). Right section: currency code text "USD", country flag emoji 🇺🇸 (16px), help icon "?" in circle, "List your property" text link, user display name "Sarah" with small avatar circle showing initials "SJ" in a colored circle. All text white, 14px. See `assets/screenshots/homepage_01.jpg` for exact layout.

- [x] **Navigation tabs**: Row below header, `#003580` background (same blue, but visually separated). Six tabs in a horizontal row with icons + text: `🏨 Stays` (active by default), `✈️ Flights`, `🏨✈️ Flight + Hotel`, `🚗 Car rentals`, `🎫 Attractions`, `🚕 Airport taxis`. Active tab has white pill background (rounded, semi-transparent white). Inactive tabs are white text only. Only "Stays" is functional — clicking other tabs shows a toast "Coming soon" or does nothing. See `assets/screenshots/homepage_01.jpg`.

### Homepage

- [x] **Homepage hero section**: Full-width section with background image (use a CSS gradient fallback: `linear-gradient(135deg, #003580 0%, #0071C2 100%)`). White text overlay: Large heading "Find deals for any season" (32px bold), subtitle "From cozy bed & breakfasts to luxury hotels" (18px normal). Below this, optionally a "Discover vacation rentals" yellow button. See `assets/screenshots/search_results_000005.jpg` for the cleaner version of this layout.

- [x] **Search bar (homepage)**: The most important interactive element. Horizontal bar with thick yellow/gold border (`3px solid #FEBB02`), white background, positioned overlapping the hero section bottom. Four sections side by side with thin gray vertical dividers:
  1. **Destination**: Bed icon (🛏️) + text input placeholder "Where are you going?" — clicking opens destination autocomplete dropdown
  2. **Dates**: Calendar icon (📅) + "Check-in — Check-out" placeholder text — clicking opens date picker
  3. **Guests**: Person icon (👤) + "2 adults · 0 children · 1 room" text — clicking opens guest selector dropdown
  4. **Search button**: Bright blue (`#0071C2`) background, white bold text "Search", ~120px wide
  Below the search bar: Checkbox "☐ I'm traveling for work" (small, 12px gray text)
  Search button navigates to `/searchresults` with query params.

- [x] **Destination autocomplete dropdown**: When user types in destination field, show a dropdown below with matching results from the destinations array. Each row: icon (🏙️ for city, 🏨 for hotel, ✈️ for region), destination name in bold, country name in gray, property count (e.g., "1,847 properties"). Dropdown has white background, subtle shadow, max 6 results. Clicking a result fills the input and sets `searchParams.destinationId`.

- [x] **Date picker popup**: Clicking the dates field opens a calendar popup. Show **two months side by side** (current and next month). Each month: month name + year header with `<` `>` navigation arrows, 7-column grid (Mon-Sun), date cells. Click first date → sets check-in (highlighted blue circle), click second date → sets check-out (highlighted blue circle), range between highlighted light blue. Show "X nights" badge between dates. Disable past dates (grayed out). Close on second click or "Done" button at bottom.

- [x] **Guests/rooms dropdown**: Clicking guests field opens a dropdown with three rows of +/– stepper controls:
  - `Adults` (min 1, max 30, default 2) — `[-]` count `[+]`
  - `Children` (min 0, max 10, default 0) — when > 0, show age dropdown(s) for each child (0-17)
  - `Rooms` (min 1, max 30, default 1) — `[-]` count `[+]`
  "Done" blue button at bottom to close. Stepper buttons: gray circular, `–` and `+` symbols. Minus disabled (grayed) when at min value.

- [x] **Homepage offers section**: Below search bar. Heading "Offers" (24px bold), subtitle "Promotions, deals, and special offers for you". Horizontal scrollable cards (2-3 visible). Each card: left image thumbnail, right content with bold title ("Save 15% or more"), description text, blue "Explore deals" button. Cards have white background, border-radius 8px, subtle shadow.

- [x] **Homepage trending destinations**: Heading "Trending destinations" + subtitle "Most popular choices for travelers from the United States". Horizontal row of 5 destination cards. First row: 2 large cards (50% each). Second row: 3 cards (33% each). Each card: background image with dark overlay at bottom, white text overlay: city name (bold, 20px), country flag emoji + country name. Clicking navigates to `/searchresults?dest=<id>`.

- [x] **Homepage browse by property type**: Heading "Browse by property type". Horizontal scrollable row of type cards: Hotels, Apartments, Resorts, Villas, Cabins, Cottages, Glamping, Guest houses. Each card: square image thumbnail (150px), type name below in bold, count text in gray (e.g., "345,123 hotels").

Text "Sort by:" then clickable sort option buttons/tabs: "Our top picks" (default, bold), "Price (lowest first)", "Best reviewed and lowest price", "Property rating (high to low)", "Property rating (low to high)".

## P2 — Secondary Features

Depth and realism, implement after P1 is complete.

- [x] **Saved/wishlist page**: Route `/saved`. Header "My next trip" with heart icon. Grid of saved property cards (same format as search results cards). "Remove from saved" (filled heart → unfilled heart toggle). Empty state: "Save your favorite properties" with heart icon illustration.

- [x] **Heart/save toggle interaction**: On all property cards (search results + detail page), clicking the heart icon: toggles `savedProperties` in user state, shows brief toast "Saved!" or "Removed from saved", heart fills red (♥) or empties (♡) with subtle animation.

- [ ] **Recently viewed properties**: Homepage section "Recently viewed" showing horizontal scroll of property cards the user has viewed (tracked in state). Each mini-card: thumbnail, name, location, price, score.

- [ ] **Map view toggle**: On search results, "Show on map" button toggles between list view and map view. Map view: full-width container with colored circles at property coordinates showing price ("$189"). Clicking a marker shows a mini property card popup. Use a simplified CSS-based map (colored rectangles representing a city grid) since we can't use Google Maps API.

- [ ] **Property detail — location map**: Static map placeholder in property detail page. Show property marker + nearby landmark labels. "Excellent location — rated X.X" score above the map.

- [ ] **Deals and promotion badges**: On property cards, conditionally show badges:

  - Score filter: "All scores", "Wonderful: 9+", "Very Good: 8+", "Good: 7+"

- [ ] **Currency selector modal**: Clicking "USD" in header opens a modal/dropdown with currency grid. Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, SEK, NOK, DKK, etc. Each row: flag + currency code + currency name. Selecting one updates `user.currency` and all displayed prices (multiply by simple mock exchange rates).

- [x] **User profile dropdown**: Clicking user avatar/name in header opens a dropdown menu:
  - "Manage account" (stub)
  - "Bookings & Trips" → `/mytrips`
  - "Reviews" (stub)
  - "Saved" → `/saved`
  - "Genius loyalty program" (stub)
  - Divider
  - "Sign out" (non-functional, shows toast "Demo mode — sign out disabled")

- [x] **Footer**: Full-width dark section (`#1a1a2e` or `#262626` background). Multi-column layout:
  - Column 1: "Support" — Customer Service Help, Coronavirus (COVID-19) FAQs, Safety Resource Center

  - Bottom row: Copyright text "Copyright © 1996–2025 Booking.com. All rights reserved."

- [ ] **"No dates selected" state**: When search bar dates are empty, property cards show "Check prices" instead of a specific price, and the date picker should auto-open when user navigates to search results without dates.

- [ ] **Search result count & breadcrumbs**: Top of search results: breadcrumb "Home > [Country] > [City]", then "[City]: X properties found" with count updating as filters are applied. Show number of filtered results vs total.

- [ ] **Loading/skeleton states**: When navigating between pages, show skeleton loading placeholders:
  - Search results: Gray animated pulse rectangles in place of property cards
  - Property detail: Gray rectangles for photo grid, text lines for descriptions
  - Simulate 300-500ms delay before showing real content

## Data Seed (implement in createInitialData())

Dev must create realistic seed data matching these specs. See `assets/data_model.md` for complete entity definitions and example values.

- [x] **User**: 1 pre-logged-in user — "Sarah Johnson", Genius Level 1, 2/5 bookings toward Level 2, currency USD, country United States. See §User in data_model.md.

- [x] **Destinations**: 10 destinations — New York, Paris, London, Tokyo, Barcelona, Rome, Dubai, Amsterdam, Bali, Los Angeles. Each with id, name, country, countryCode, propertyCount, trending flag. See §Destination in data_model.md.

- [x] **Properties**: 12 properties across destinations — mix of: 5-star luxury hotel, 4-star business hotel, 3-star boutique hotel, 2-star budget hotel, apartments, resort, villa, guesthouse, hostel. Mix of price ranges ($42–$589), review scores (7.2–9.6), with/without Genius, with/without free cancellation, with/without breakfast. See §Property in data_model.md.

- [x] **Rooms**: 2-3 rooms per property (~30 total) — each property has at least a standard and premium option. Fields: name, type, maxGuests, bedType, size, pricePerNight, amenities, view, cancellation policy. See §Room in data_model.md.

- [x] **Reviews**: 3-5 reviews per property (~40-50 total). Diverse: different traveler types (solo, couple, family, business, group), different countries, different scores (7-10), mix of positive-only and positive+negative comments. Each property also has aggregated category scores (staff, facilities, cleanliness, comfort, value, location, wifi). See §Review in data_model.md.

- [x] **Bookings**: 3 pre-existing bookings — 1 upcoming confirmed (New York, March 2025), 1 future confirmed (Tokyo, May 2025), 1 past completed (Paris, October 2024). See §Booking in data_model.md.

- [x] **Photos**: 6-10 photos per property. Since this is a mock, generate placeholder images using CSS gradients or colored rectangles with category labels ("Room", "Bathroom", "Pool", "Exterior", "Lobby", "Restaurant"). Use an array of gradient colors to make them visually distinct. Alternative: use `https://picsum.photos/SEED/WIDTH/HEIGHT` for real placeholder images with property-specific seeds.

---

## Out of Scope

Dev must NOT implement these:

- **Authentication / login** — App starts pre-logged-in as "Sarah Johnson". Register/Sign in buttons in header are visible but non-functional.
- **Real payment processing** — "Complete Booking" button creates a mock booking in state; no Stripe/PayPal integration.
- **Real-time availability** — All rooms always have availability. No actual inventory management.
- **Email/SMS notifications** — Confirmation page shown but no real messages sent.
- **Google Maps integration** — Use placeholder map or simple CSS-based map for location display.
- **Flight/Car/Attractions booking** — Nav tabs exist but only "Stays" is functional. Others show "Coming soon" toast or are inert.
- **File uploads** — No actual photo upload for reviews or profile.
- **Real currency conversion** — Use simple mock exchange rates (×0.85 for EUR, ×0.79 for GBP, etc.) or just display USD everywhere.
- **Responsive mobile layout** — Desktop-first; mobile responsiveness is nice-to-have but not required.
- **Accessibility (WCAG)** — Not required for this training mock, but basic keyboard navigation is appreciated.
