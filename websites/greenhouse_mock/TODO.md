## P0 — Core Shell
<!-- Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] **Project scaffold**: `npm create vite@latest greenhouse_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`, `recharts`, `date-fns`, `clsx`, `uuid`. No TypeScript — plain JSX.

- [x] **Visual design system**: Study `assets/screenshots/` carefully. The Greenhouse UI uses a **dark green top bar** and clean white/gray content area. Exact palette:
  - Top nav bar background: `#1B3A2D` (very dark forest green)
  - Primary accent / buttons / links: `#2D9D78` (teal-green)
  - Primary accent hover: `#248A69`
  - Logo green: `#3BB893`
  - Page background: `#F5F5F5` (light gray)
  - Card/panel background: `#FFFFFF`
  - Text primary: `#1A1A1A`
  - Text secondary: `#6B7280`
  - Text muted: `#9CA3AF`
  - Border: `#E5E7EB`
  - Divider: `#F3F4F6`
  - Red (needs action / strong no): `#DC2626`
  - Yellow (needs scorecard / warning): `#F59E0B`
  - Green (hired / strong yes): `#16A34A`
  - Blue (info): `#2563EB`
  - Font family: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif`
  - Font sizes: 12px (small labels), 14px (body/nav), 16px (card headers), 20px (page titles), 24px (main headings)
  - Border radius: 6px (cards), 4px (buttons/inputs), 50% (avatars)
  - Box shadow on cards: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`

- [x] **App layout**: Full-width layout, no sidebar. Top navigation bar is 56px tall, dark green (`#1B3A2D`), horizontally arranged:
  - **Left section**: Greenhouse "g" logo icon (stylized lowercase "g" with a circle — use an SVG or text rendering in `#3BB893`) + "Recruiting" text in white, 16px medium weight
  - **Center/Nav tabs**: Horizontal tab links — "All Jobs", "Candidates", "Reports" — white text 14px, active tab has white underline 2px bottom border. Spacing: 24px between tabs
  - **Right section**: Search icon (magnifying glass), notification bell icon with badge count, user greeting "Hi Jules" + 32px round avatar
  Content area: below nav, `max-width: 1200px`, centered, `padding: 24px`

- [x] **Routing**: `App.jsx` with `BrowserRouter`, routes:
  - `/` → Dashboard (redirect to `/dashboard`)
  - `/dashboard` → Dashboard page
  - `/jobs` → All Jobs list
  - `/jobs/:jobId` → Job detail (with sub-routes: overview, pipeline, candidates, setup)
  - `/jobs/:jobId/pipeline` → Visual pipeline kanban
  - `/jobs/:jobId/candidates` → Job candidate list
  - `/candidates` → All Candidates list
  - `/candidates/:candidateId` → Candidate profile
  - `/candidates/:candidateId/scorecard/:scorecardId` → Scorecard view/edit
  - `/reports` → Reports dashboard
  - `/reports/:reportId` → Individual report
  - `/interviews` → All upcoming interviews
  - `/go` → State inspector (Go.jsx)
  All routes must preserve `?sid=` query parameter across navigation using a helper component.

- [x] **State management**: `AppContext.jsx` with `useReducer`. Actions:
  - `SET_STATE` — bulk state replacement (for POST /post)
  - `UPDATE_JOB` — update job fields
  - `ADD_JOB` — create new job
  - `UPDATE_APPLICATION` — update application fields (stage, status, etc.)
  - `ADD_APPLICATION` — add candidate to job
  - `MOVE_APPLICATION_STAGE` — move candidate to different pipeline stage
  - `REJECT_APPLICATION` — reject with reason
  - `ADD_CANDIDATE` — create new candidate
  - `UPDATE_CANDIDATE` — update candidate fields
  - `ADD_SCORECARD` — create new scorecard
  - `UPDATE_SCORECARD` — submit/update scorecard
  - `ADD_INTERVIEW` — schedule interview
  - `UPDATE_INTERVIEW` — update interview details
  - `ADD_OFFER` — create offer
  - `UPDATE_OFFER` — update offer status
  - `ADD_NOTE` — add note to candidate
  - `UPDATE_NOTE` — edit/pin note
  - `DELETE_NOTE` — remove note
  - `ADD_NOTIFICATION` — add notification
  - `MARK_NOTIFICATION_READ` — mark single as read
  - `MARK_ALL_NOTIFICATIONS_READ` — mark all as read
  - `ADD_ACTIVITY` — add activity feed entry
  State is initialized from `dataManager.js`'s `createInitialData()` and persisted to localStorage.

- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` at `/go` route. Returns JSON: `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. `initial_state` is captured on first load, `current_state` is live state from context, `state_diff` is a deep diff showing only changed fields. Display as formatted JSON in a `<pre>` tag with monospace font.

- [x] **Session isolation**: `vite.config.js` mock-api plugin implementing:
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with `{"action":"set","state":{...}}` — sets both initial + current state
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with `{"action":"set_current","state":{...}}` — updates only current state
  - `POST /post?sid=<sid>` with `{"action":"reset"}` — resets to initial
  - `GET /go?sid=<sid>` → `{initial_state, current_state, state_diff}`
  - `POST /upload?sid=<sid>` — multipart file upload
  - `GET /files/<sid>/<filename>` — serve uploaded files
  Session state stored in-memory Map keyed by sid. When no sid, use default session.

## Data Seed (implement in createInitialData())
<!-- Dev must create realistic seed data matching these specs. -->

- [x] **Users**: 8 users as specified in `data_model.md §Users`. Current user is Jules Park (user-1, recruiter). Include realistic titles and departments.

- [x] **Jobs**: 6 jobs as specified in `data_model.md §Jobs`. 5 open, 1 closed. Each with distinct department/office combinations. Each open job has 8 default pipeline stages.

- [x] **Candidates**: 20 candidates with diverse, realistic names (mix of ethnicities/genders). Each has: current company (real-sounding tech companies: "Stripe", "Figma", "Airbnb", "Notion", etc.), current title, location, source. At least 3 referrals, 10 applied, 5 sourced, 2 agency.

- [x] **Applications**: 25 applications. Distribution: Senior Frontend Engineer job gets 8 applications (at various stages from Application Review to Offer), Product Designer gets 5, Backend Engineer gets 6, Product Manager gets 4, Marketing Coordinator gets 2. Include 3 rejected applications (different reasons), 1 hired. Ensure each pipeline stage has at least 1-2 candidates for the main jobs so the pipeline view is interesting.

- [x] **Scorecards**: 15 scorecards. 10 submitted with varied ratings and recommendations (mix of strong_yes to strong_no), 5 pending (submittedAt=null). Associate with applications in Phone Screen and Interview stages.

- [x] **Interviews**: 10 interviews. 4 scheduled (future dates relative to "today"), 5 completed, 1 cancelled. Various durations and locations.

- [x] **Offers**: 3 offers. 1 pending_approval (for a Senior Frontend Engineer candidate), 1 sent (for Product Designer), 1 accepted (for the closed DevOps Engineer job, establishing a "hired" candidate).

- [x] **Notes**: 12 notes across 8 different candidates. Mix of public/private visibility. 2 pinned. Content like "Strong React experience, ask about system design in onsite", "Candidate preferred hybrid schedule", "Referred by our CTO, prioritize".

- [x] **Activity Feed**: 30+ entries covering: application_submitted (for each application), stage_change events, scorecard_submitted events, note_added, interview_scheduled, offer_created. Spread across the last 30 days with realistic timestamps.

- [x] **Notifications**: 8 for current user (Jules Park). 3 unread: "New application from Alex Chen for Senior Frontend Engineer", "Scorecard due: Interview with Maria Santos", "Offer awaiting your approval: Product Designer". 5 read: older application notifications, interview reminders, stage changes.

- AI-powered features (job description generation, candidate summaries)
- Greenhouse Onboarding module (separate product)
- CRM / prospect nurturing campaigns
- Third-party integrations or webhooks
- EEOC/diversity compliance reporting
