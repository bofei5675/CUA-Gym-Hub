# PayPal Mock — Research Summary

## App Overview

PayPal is a digital financial services platform that enables users to send/receive money, manage payment methods, track transactions, create invoices, and manage subscriptions. Founded in 1998, it is one of the world's largest online payment processors operating in 200+ markets and 140 currencies.

This mock replicates the **PayPal personal account web dashboard** (desktop) — the logged-in experience at `paypal.com/myaccount/`.

## Key User Personas

1. **Personal User** (primary): Sends money to friends/family, receives payments, tracks spending, manages linked cards/banks
2. **Freelancer/Small Business**: Creates and sends invoices, generates payment links, tracks income/expenses
3. **Online Shopper**: Uses PayPal balance for purchases, tracks orders, manages subscriptions, opens disputes

**Default mock user**: Personal user with some freelancing activity (has both sent payments and invoices).
