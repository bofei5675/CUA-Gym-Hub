## P0 — Core Shell

<!-- Without these, the app cannot render. Dev implements these first. -->

- [x] Project scaffold: `npm create vite@latest gusto_mock -- --template react`, install deps: `react-router-dom`
- [x] **Visual design system**: Gusto uses a clean, friendly aesthetic. Study `assets/screenshots/gusto_000001.jpg` and `assets/screenshots/000001.jpg` carefully. Color palette: primary coral `#F45D48` (logo, accents), teal `#0A8080` (active nav items, links, primary buttons), white `#FFFFFF` (sidebar & content bg), light gray `#F7F7F7` (page background), dark charcoal `#1A1A1A` (text), medium gray `#666666` (secondary text), border `#E0E0E0`. Font: system sans-serif (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`). Heading: 28px/700, subheading: 20px/600, body: 14px/400, small: 12px/400. Border radius: 4-6px for inputs/cards, 8px for modals. Subtle box shadows for cards: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`.
- [x] **App layout** (see screenshots `gusto_000001.jpg`, `000001.jpg`): Fixed left sidebar 220px wide, white bg, Gusto logo ("gusto" in coral lowercase) top-left with 24px padding. Top bar: 56px height, right side has search input (pill-shaped, gray border, placeholder "Search people"), notification bell icon, user avatar circle (initials "JJ" on teal bg) + name "Jessica Jackson" + role "Administrator" with dropdown chevron. Main content area: `calc(100vw - 220px)` width, light gray `#F7F7F7` bg, content column centered max-width 900px with 32px padding.
- [x] **Sidebar navigation**: Implement exactly as shown in `assets/screenshots/000001.jpg`. Structure: Logo area → "Home" link → "People" section (expandable, sub-items: Team members, Org chart, Team insights, Performance) → "Company" link → "Payroll" section (expandable, sub-items: Run Payroll, Pay Contractors) → "Time tools" section (expandable, sub-items: Time Tracking, Time Off) → "Benefits" link → "Taxes & compliance" link → separator → "Reports" link → "App directory" link → separator → "Settings" link → "Refer & earn" link → "Help" link. Active item: teal text `#0A8080` with 3px left teal border. Hover: light gray bg `#F5F5F5`. Expand/collapse with chevron icons. Sub-items indented 16px.
- [x] **Routing** in App.jsx with BrowserRouter. Routes: `/` → Home, `/people/team-members` → TeamMembers, `/people/team-members/:id` → EmployeeProfile, `/people/org-chart` → OrgChart, `/people/team-insights` → TeamInsights, `/people/performance` → Performance, `/company` → CompanyDetails, `/payroll/run` → RunPayroll, `/payroll/history` → PayrollHistory, `/payroll/contractors` → PayContractors, `/time-tools/time-tracking` → TimeTracking, `/time-tools/time-off` → TimeOff, `/benefits` → Benefits, `/taxes` → TaxesCompliance, `/reports` → Reports, `/documents` → Documents, `/settings` → Settings, `/go` → StateInspector
- [x] **State management**: Create `src/context/AppContext.jsx` wrapping entire app. Create `src/utils/dataManager.js` with `createInitialData()` that returns all entities defined in `assets/data_model.md`. Persist to localStorage under key `gusto_mock_state`. Provide `getState()`, `setState()`, `resetState()`, `getStateDiff()` functions.
- [x] **`/go` endpoint**: `src/pages/Go.jsx` route renders JSON with `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. Style as raw JSON in `<pre>` tag with monospace font.
- [x] **Session isolation**: Configure `vite.config.js` with mock-api plugin. `POST /post?sid=<sid>` accepts `{ action: "set"|"set_current"|"reset", state: {...} }`. `GET /go?sid=<sid>` returns `{ initial_state, current_state, state_diff }`. If no `sid` param, use default "main" session. Store sessions in memory Map.

## Out of Scope

<!-- Dev must NOT implement these. -->

- Authentication / login / logout (app starts pre-logged-in as "Jessica Jackson", Administrator)
- Real tax calculations (display realistic static/computed numbers)
- Actual payment processing or bank transfers
- Email or SMS notifications
- Real file uploads (documents are metadata-only)
- Third-party integrations / App directory functional connections
- Mobile responsive layout (desktop-only is fine)
- Actual W-2/1099 PDF generation
