## Notes on Mock Implementation

### What to Skip
- Authentication / login (app starts pre-logged-in as property owner)
- Real Google API connections
- BigQuery export functionality
- Google Ads linking (can show UI placeholder)
- Actual data collection / tag management
- Real-time WebSocket updates (simulate with static data)

### Key Implementation Notes
- All data is generated mock data — realistic numbers for a medium-sized e-commerce website
- Property name: "GA4 - Acme Store" for the mock
- Date ranges should show realistic data that changes when the date range selector is adjusted
- Charts should use a charting library (recharts recommended for React)
- Tables should be sortable by clicking column headers
- The "comparison" feature (preceding period) should show computed % change values
