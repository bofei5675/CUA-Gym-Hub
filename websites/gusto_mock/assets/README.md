# Gusto Mock — Research Summary

## App Overview

**Gusto** is a cloud-based HR, payroll, and benefits platform designed for small-to-medium businesses. It provides an all-in-one admin dashboard where employers can run payroll, manage employees, track time, administer benefits, handle tax compliance, and generate reports. Gusto is known for its clean, friendly, and approachable design — making complex payroll/HR workflows feel simple.

**Target user**: Small business owner or HR admin managing 5-50 employees.

## Key Personas

1. **Admin / Business Owner (Jessica Jackson)** — Primary user. Runs payroll, adds employees, manages benefits, views reports. This is the persona we mock.
2. **Employee** — Views pay stubs, requests time off, updates personal info. (Secondary — not the focus of this mock.)
