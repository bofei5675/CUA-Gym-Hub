# Outlook Web Mock — Research Summary

## App Overview

**Outlook on the web** (formerly Outlook Web App / OWA, accessible at outlook.live.com and outlook.office365.com) is Microsoft's flagship web-based email and productivity client. It combines email, calendar, contacts (People), and task management into a unified web experience that closely mirrors the desktop Outlook application. As of 2024-2025, Microsoft has consolidated its Windows Mail and Calendar apps into the "New Outlook" interface, which shares the same web codebase.

**Category:** Email / Productivity Suite (web-based)
**Competitors:** Gmail, Yahoo Mail, ProtonMail, Fastmail
**Distinguishing features:** Focused Inbox (AI-sorted), deep Microsoft 365 integration, combined Mail+Calendar+People+To-Do in one app, rich formatting toolbar (ribbon), multiple account support.
