# ServiceNow Mock — Research Summary

## App Overview

**ServiceNow** is a cloud-based enterprise IT Service Management (ITSM) platform built on ITIL standards. It enables organizations to automate IT business management through digital workflows. The platform's core use case is IT service desk operations—managing incidents, problems, changes, and service requests—but it extends to HR, customer service, and more.

ServiceNow is distinguished by its:
- **Single data model** across all applications
- **Configurable workflow engine** for process automation
- **Multi-instance architecture** with 99.8% availability
- **Table-driven everything**: every entity (incident, user, CI) is a "table" with records

For our mock, we focus on the **ITSM modules** (Incident, Problem, Change, Service Catalog, Knowledge Base, CMDB) as these represent the core user workflows.
