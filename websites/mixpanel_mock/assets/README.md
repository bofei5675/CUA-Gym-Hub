# Mixpanel Mock -- Research Summary

## App Overview

Mixpanel is a product analytics platform that helps teams understand how users interact with digital products. It tracks user events (clicks, page views, form submissions, etc.) and provides powerful visualization and analysis tools: Insights (time-series charts), Funnels (conversion analysis), Flows (user journey visualization), Retention (cohort-based return analysis), and Session Replay (recorded user sessions). Data is organized into Boards (dashboards) that combine multiple report cards, text blocks, and media.

## Key User Personas

1. **Product Manager** -- Creates boards with key metrics, builds funnel reports to measure feature conversion, monitors retention cohorts, shares reports with stakeholders.
2. **Data Analyst** -- Builds complex Insights reports with multiple metrics, filters, breakdowns; uses formulas and custom properties; exports data; manages Lexicon (data dictionary).
3. **Engineering Lead** -- Reviews events in the Events view, checks event properties, monitors data quality via Lexicon, reviews Session Replays for debugging.

## Core Workflows

1. View a Board (dashboard) with multiple report cards
2. Create/edit an Insights report (line chart, bar chart, table) with metrics, filters, breakdowns
3. Create/edit a Funnels report (multi-step conversion analysis)
4. Browse the Events stream (raw event log with expandable details)
5. Browse Users list with profiles
6. Manage the Lexicon (data dictionary -- events, event properties, profile properties)
7. View Session Replays (recorded user sessions with event timeline)
8. Navigate between boards, reports, and data views via the sidebar
9. Configure project settings (org, project, profile)
