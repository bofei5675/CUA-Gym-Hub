## Notes for Implementation

### What to Skip (Out of Scope)
- **Authentication**: App starts pre-logged-in as "Rakesh Mondal" (or similar default user)
- **Real email sending**: All send actions are simulated (update status to "Sent", generate mock report data)
- **Real SMTP/delivery**: No actual emails leave the system
- **Payment/billing**: No pricing pages or upgrade flows needed
- **Real file uploads to servers**: Content Studio can simulate uploaded files with placeholder images
- **Integrations with 3rd-party services**: Integration page can show list but no real connections

### Key Interaction Patterns
- **Create button modal**: Clicking "Create" in sidebar opens a modal/dropdown with campaign type options (Email, Customer Journey, Email Template, Landing Page, Survey)
- **Campaign wizard**: Step-by-step flow where each section (To, From, Subject, Content) can be clicked to expand/edit
- **Table interactions**: Sort by clicking column headers, filter via dropdown, search via text input, bulk select via checkboxes
- **Email editor**: Simplified drag-and-drop with content blocks panel on left, live preview on right
- **Segment builder**: Condition rows with [Field] [Operator] [Value] pattern, add/remove conditions
