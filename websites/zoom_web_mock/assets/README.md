# Zoom Web Mock — Research Summary

## Application Overview

**Zoom** (now branded as **Zoom Workplace**) is the world's leading video conferencing and unified communications platform. Founded in 2011 by Eric Yuan, it provides video meetings, team chat, VoIP phone, webinars, whiteboards, and more. The desktop/web client is the primary interface for scheduling, joining, and managing meetings.

**Target interface**: Zoom Workplace desktop/web client (not the admin web portal at zoom.us). This mock simulates the client application accessible at `app.zoom.us/wc/home` or the desktop app, which share a very similar UI.
