# DocuSign Mock — Research Summary

## App Overview

**DocuSign** is the world's leading electronic signature platform (61% market share, 1.7M+ customers). It allows users to prepare documents, place signature/form fields, send them to recipients for signing, and track envelope status through completion. The core product is **DocuSign eSignature**.

**Our mock target**: The DocuSign eSignature web application at `app.docusign.com` — the sender/manager dashboard experience, plus a simulated signing experience for recipients.
